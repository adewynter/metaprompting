    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome0": "One of the main benefits of allocating more funds to education and preventative measures is that they can reduce the burden on the health system by decreasing the number of patients who need treatment. by raising awareness and promoting healthy behaviors, such as vaccination, nutrition, exercise, and hygiene, society can prevent many diseases and complications that would otherwise require hospitalization or medication. for example, educating people about the risks of smoking and offering them support to quit can lower the incidence of lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. similarly, teaching people how to manage their blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes can prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney failure. thus, education and preventative measures can not only improve the quality of life of individuals, but also free up resources and capacity in the health system for those who need them most.",
      "Outcome1": "One way to educate and raise awareness of health issues is to provide information and campaigns on the causes and consequences of common and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular problems, and cancer. these diseases can have a significant impact on the quality of life and the mortality of the patients, as well as on the costs and resources of the health system. however, many of them can be prevented or delayed by adopting healthy lifestyles, such as eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, and undergoing regular check-ups and screenings. by investing in education and preventative measures, society can reduce the risk factors and the incidence of these diseases, and therefore, improve the health outcomes and the efficiency of the health system.",
      "Outcome2": "The left text argues that education and prevention should receive a greater budget because they can reduce the pressure on the health system and improve the quality of care for existing patients. however, the benefits of prevention are not only limited to the health sector, but also extend to the individuals and the society as a whole. the right text could elaborate on this point by providing some examples of how prevention can enhance the well-being, productivity, and social cohesion of people. for instance, prevention can help individuals avoid chronic diseases, disabilities, and premature deaths that can impair their physical and mental health, as well as their ability to work and participate in social activities. moreover, prevention can help society save resources, reduce inequalities, and promote solidarity among its members, as fewer people would need expensive and intensive treatments, more people would have access to quality health services, and more people would contribute to the common good. therefore, prevention is not only a cost-effective strategy, but also a moral and ethical duty for the society.",
      "Outcome3": "In conclusion, i have argued that education and preventative measures are more beneficial for the society than spending more money on treatment. by investing in these areas, we can reduce the burden on the health system, improve the quality of care for existing patients, and prevent many diseases from occurring in the first place. however, some people may disagree with this view and claim that treatment is more urgent and effective than prevention. in the following paragraph, i will examine this counter-argument and explain why i think it is flawed.",
      "Outcome4": "However, implementing education and preventative measures in the health system may not be easy or feasible in some contexts. for example, some communities may face barriers such as lack of access to reliable information, cultural beliefs, or socioeconomic factors that may limit their ability or willingness to adopt healthy behaviors or seek preventive services. moreover, some diseases or conditions may not be preventable or predictable, and may require urgent or specialized care that cannot be replaced by education or prevention. therefore, while education and preventative measures are important and beneficial, they should not be seen as the only or the best solution for all health problems, and they should be complemented by a robust and responsive health system that can meet the diverse and changing needs of the population.",
      "Outcome5": "",
      "Outcome6": "The left text argues that education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget than treatment because they can reduce the burden on the health system and improve the quality of care for existing patients. the right text supports this claim by explaining how educating society and raising awareness of health issues can help people avoid illnesses and take precautions that can prevent complications. thus, the right text provides an example of how education and prevention can benefit both individuals and the health system as a whole.",
      "Outcome7": "One way to educate and prevent health issues is to promote healthy lifestyles and habits among the population. for example, encouraging people to exercise regularly, eat a balanced diet, avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, and practice good hygiene can help prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and obesity. these diseases are often costly and difficult to treat and can reduce the quality of life and productivity of the affected individuals. by investing more in education and prevention, the government can save money and resources in the long run and improve the overall well-being of the society. the first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system."

      "Outcome7": "In order to agree with the notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers, it is necessary to consider how this evaluation could benefit both teachers and the educational system as a whole. the left text argues that getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance, and that evaluating teachers from students' perspectives is one of the ways to improve the quality of education. the right text develops this argument further by showing how this evaluation could improve schools' quality, as teachers could augment their own quality and contribute to the intellectual development of students. however, how can this evaluation be implemented effectively and fairly? how can teachers use the feedback from students to enhance their teaching methods and skills? how can schools ensure that the evaluation is not influenced by bias, prejudice, or personal preferences? these are some of the questions that need to be addressed in the following paragraph."

      "Outcome1": "One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. they can have a serious impact on people in their puberty, who are undergoing physical and psychological changes and are more susceptible to external influences. for instance, some studies have shown that exposure to violent media can increase aggression, desensitization, and fear in young people, while sexual media can affect their sexual attitudes, behaviours, and expectations. an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. such a programme can distort the reality of violence and its consequences, and may encourage imitation or indifference. another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. a few years ago there was a japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. this is actually very environmentally unfriendly.",
      "Outcome2": "The left text argues that tighter media control is needed to limit the violent and sexual content of the media, which can have a harmful influence on young people. the right text further supports this claim by pointing out that some foreign programmes that are imported by television companies may also pose a threat to the local culture and values of the audiences. for instance, some foreign programmes may promote materialism, consumerism, individualism, or other ideologies that are incompatible with the traditional or religious beliefs of the local community. some foreign programmes may also ridicule or stereotype the local customs, history, or identity, or show disrespect or ignorance towards the local issues or challenges. such programmes may erode the sense of belonging, pride, or solidarity of the local people, or create conflicts or misunderstandings among different groups. therefore, the author suggests that tighter media control is necessary to protect the local culture and values from the negative effects of foreign programmes.",
      "Outcome3": "These are some of the reasons why some people advocate for more regulation of the media, especially in terms of the violence and sexual content that can influence young minds and behaviour. they believe that the media should be more responsible and respectful of the local values and norms, and not expose the audience to harmful or inappropriate messages. however, not everyone agrees with this view. there are also arguments that favour more freedom and diversity in the media, and that challenge the assumptions and effects of media control.",
      "Outcome4": "However, some might argue that tighter media control is unnecessary and even harmful to the freedom of expression and diversity of opinions. they might claim that viewers have the right to choose what they want to watch and that they can distinguish between reality and fiction. they might also contend that foreign programmes can enrich the local culture and foster mutual understanding and respect. these arguments, however, are not convincing enough. firstly, not all viewers, especially children and adolescents, have the ability or the guidance to filter out the negative influences of violent and sexual content. they might imitate or internalize what they see and develop aggressive or irresponsible behaviours. secondly, not all foreign programmes are beneficial or appropriate for the local culture. some might contain offensive or misleading messages that could undermine the values and identity of the local society. therefore, tighter media control is justified and necessary to protect the public interest and morality.",
      "Outcome5": "However, not everyone agrees that tighter media control is necessary or beneficial. opponents of this view argue that media consumers have the right to choose what they want to watch or read, and that censorship violates their freedom of expression and creativity. they also point out that media content can be educational, entertaining, or inspiring, and that exposure to different cultures and perspectives can broaden one's horizons and promote tolerance. for instance, a japanese game show that involved throwing cream cakes to the loser might seem wasteful and disrespectful, but it could also be seen as a humorous and harmless way of having fun and relieving stress.",

      "Outcome7": "However, not everyone agrees that tighter media control is necessary or beneficial. some opponents argue that media consumers have the right to choose what they want to watch or read, and that censorship violates their freedom of expression and creativity. they also point out that media violence and sexuality are not the main causes of social problems, and that other factors, such as education, family, and peer influence, play a more important role in shaping people's behaviour and attitudes. moreover, they claim that exposure to foreign programmes can also have positive effects, such as enhancing cultural diversity and awareness, and stimulating curiosity and learning. for instance, the japanese game show mentioned above could also be seen as a humorous and harmless way of entertaining the audience and the participants."

      "Outcome1": "Pollution and traffic problems are serious issues that affect the health and well-being of millions of people around the world. according to the world health organization, air pollution alone causes about 7 million premature deaths every year, and contributes to climate change, acid rain, and ozone depletion. moreover, traffic congestion wastes time, energy, and money, and increases the risk of accidents, noise, and stress. some of the main causes of these problems are the rapid urbanization, industrialization, and population growth, which have led to a high demand for transportation, energy, and resources, and a lack of adequate planning, regulation, and management. therefore, it is urgent and necessary to find effective and sustainable solutions to address these challenges and improve the quality of life for current and future generations. as illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the most effective ways to tackle the pollution and traffic issues is to enhance the quality and accessibility of public transportation facilities. by building more bus lines, expanding subway networks, and providing convenient and affordable fares, authorities can encourage more people to choose public transport over private cars. this can not only reduce the demand for parking spaces and the consumption of fossil fuels, but also lower the emissions of pollutants that harm the environment and human health. moreover, by easing the congestion of roads, public transport can also save time and money for commuters and improve the efficiency of urban mobility. therefore, improving public transportation facilities can be a win-win solution for both the environment and the society.",
      "Outcome3": "As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. setting temporary targets can help motivate and measure the progress of environmental improvement and provide feedback and incentives for the stakeholders involved. additionally, supervisory institutions should be built to find and address problems. these institutions can help monitor and regulate the levels of pollutants and ensure the compliance of environmental policies. they can also enforce penalties and rewards for the violators and performers of the standards and rules. moreover, they can provide guidance and support for the public and private sectors to adopt greener practices and technologies. meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, pollution and traffic problems are serious issues that affect the quality of life and health of urban residents. they require comprehensive and coordinated solutions from the authorities, the public and the private sectors. improving public transportation, setting temporary targets for pollution reduction and establishing supervisory institutions are some of the effective measures that can be taken to address these problems. however, these measures alone are not enough. it is also essential to raise the awareness and responsibility of the public towards the environment and encourage them to adopt more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyles. this can be done through education, campaigns, incentives and regulations that promote environmental values and behaviors. by doing so, not only can the current problems be alleviated, but also the future generations can inherit a cleaner and greener planet.",
      "Outcome5": "To achieve these solutions, however, it is essential to have the cooperation and participation of various stakeholders, such as the government, the public, and the private sector. the government should not only provide adequate funding and policy support for the public transportation and environmental protection projects, but also enforce strict regulations and penalties for those who violate the emission standards or cause environmental damage. the public should also take responsibility for their own travel choices and consumption habits, and adopt more eco-friendly and energy-efficient alternatives whenever possible. the private sector, especially the industries and businesses that contribute to the pollution and traffic problems, should also implement green practices and innovations, such as using renewable energy sources, recycling waste materials, and optimizing production processes. by working together, these actors can create a more sustainable and livable urban environment for themselves and future generations.",
      "Outcome6": "",
      "Outcome7": "These solutions, however, may not be sufficient to tackle the root causes of pollution and traffic problems. in order to achieve a more sustainable and livable urban environment, some fundamental changes are also needed in the way people plan, design, and manage the city. the following passage will discuss some of these changes and how they can benefit the city and its residents."

      "Outcome1": "Capital punishment can have a deterrent effect on other potential criminals who may be contemplating committing heinous crimes. by imposing the ultimate penalty for the most serious offenses, the state sends a clear message that such acts will not be tolerated and will be met with swift and severe justice. this can create a fear of the consequences and a sense of moral responsibility among the potential offenders, who may refrain from engaging in violent and immoral behavior. thus, capital punishment can reduce the crime rate by preventing some crimes from happening in the first place.",
      "Outcome2": "Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. when a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased. however, some opponents of capital punishment argue that it is not a fair and reliable system of justice. they claim that the jury giving the verdict are also humans. they can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. they point out the cases of wrongful convictions, racial bias, and arbitrariness in the application of the death penalty. they contend that capital punishment violates the principles of human dignity, equality, and due process of law. the jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. for example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.",
      "Outcome3": "The left text argues that capital punishment is a deterrent for heinous crimes, which are those that involve extreme cruelty, depravity, or malice. such crimes, according to this view, deserve the ultimate penalty of death, as they violate the basic values of humanity and justice. the right text, on the other hand, cautions against the possibility of error and injustice in the judicial system, which can lead to the execution of innocent or mitigated offenders. such offenders may have committed non-heinous crimes, which are those that do not involve the same degree of moral turpitude or harm as heinous crimes. for example, a non-heinous crime may be motivated by self-defense, necessity, or provocation, which can reduce the culpability or responsibility of the offender. therefore, the right text suggests that the jury should consider the circumstances of each case and apply capital punishment only to the most deserving and dangerous criminals.",
      "Outcome4": "Both sides of the debate on capital punishment have valid arguments. supporters of the death penalty argue that it deters other criminals from committing heinous crimes and serves justice to the victims and society. opponents of the death penalty contend that it is prone to human error and injustice, and that it does not account for the circumstances and motives of the offenders. therefore, the jury should be careful and fair in deciding who deserves to die and who does not. in my opinion, capital punishment is a harsh and irreversible measure that should be reserved for the most extreme and rare cases of evil and violence. i believe that there are alternative ways of punishing and rehabilitating criminals that respect human dignity and rights.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the arguments in favor of capital punishment is that it deters other potential offenders from committing heinous crimes. by imposing the ultimate penalty, the justice system sends a clear message that such acts will not be tolerated. however, this argument also raises the question of fairness and accuracy in the judicial process. the jury who decides the fate of the accused are human beings who can make errors or be influenced by biases. therefore, they should carefully consider the context and motive of each crime and not apply the death penalty indiscriminately. for instance, a person who kills in self-defense should not be equated with a cold-blooded murderer.",
      "Outcome6": "",
      "Outcome7": "However, not everyone agrees that capital punishment is an effective deterrent or a just punishment. some argue that the jury giving the verdict are also humans. they have the life of a person at their discretion. they can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. the jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. for example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment."

(topic sentence) one of the main disadvantages is that it might limit the freedom of expression and creativity of the media producers and consumers. media control could lead to censorship, propaganda, or bias, which would undermine the diversity and quality of the media content. another problem is that it might not be effective or feasible to regulate all the media platforms and sources, especially in the era of digital and social media. media control could be easily bypassed, challenged, or resisted by the media users who have access to alternative or illegal channels of information and entertainment. therefore, tighter media control might not be the best solution to address the issues of media content.",
      "Outcome2": "The exposure to violent and sexual content in the media can have detrimental effects on people in their puberty, who are undergoing physical and emotional changes and are more susceptible to external influences. such content can desensitize them to the real consequences of violence and aggression, or distort their expectations and perceptions of sexuality and intimacy. moreover, they might imitate or adopt the behaviours or attitudes that they see on the screen, which could lead to harmful or antisocial outcomes. for instance, they might become more aggressive, impulsive, or disrespectful towards others, or engage in risky or unhealthy sexual practices.",

      "Outcome4": "However, limiting the violent and sexual content of the media is not the only reason why some people advocate for tighter media control. another issue is the influence of foreign programmes that television companies import from time to time, which may not suit the local culture and values. these programmes may expose the audiences to different norms and behaviours that are acceptable or even entertaining in other countries, but may be offensive or harmful in their own context. for example, a few years ago there was a japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. this is actually very environmentally unfriendly, as it wastes food and creates litter. moreover, it may also encourage disrespect and humiliation of others, which may contradict the local moral standards. therefore, some people may argue that television companies should be more selective and responsible in choosing the programmes they broadcast, and not just follow the market demand or the popularity of foreign media.",
      "Outcome5": "While some people advocate for tighter media control, others oppose it on the grounds of freedom of expression and diversity of views. they argue that media consumers have the right to choose what they want to watch, read or listen to, and that they can critically evaluate the messages and values conveyed by different sources. moreover, they claim that restricting media content would stifle creativity, innovation and cultural exchange. for instance, they might point out that the internet cartoon comedy happy tree, despite its brutality, is a satire of violence and a form of artistic expression. similarly, they might defend the japanese game show as a harmless and humorous way of entertainment, and not as an example of environmental unfriendliness.",
      "Outcome6": "However, opponents of media censorship argue that restricting the freedom of expression and information is a violation of human rights and democracy. they claim that viewers have the right to choose what they want to watch and that they can exercise their own judgment and critical thinking skills to evaluate the messages and values presented by the media. furthermore, they point out that banning or editing certain content does not necessarily prevent people from accessing it through other sources, such as the internet or illegal copies, and that it might even increase their curiosity and demand. therefore, they suggest that instead of imposing media control, the government and the society should provide more education and guidance to help people, especially young people, develop media literacy and moral awareness."

      "Outcome2": "One way to implement the temporary targets and supervisory institutions is to adopt a system of emission permits and trading, which can incentivize the polluters to reduce their emissions or pay for the excess. for instance, the european union has established a cap-and-trade scheme for greenhouse gases, which covers various sectors such as power generation, industry, and aviation. the scheme sets a limit on the total amount of emissions allowed in each period, and allocates permits to the participants, which they can trade in the market. the supervisory institutions are responsible for verifying the emissions and ensuring the compliance of the participants. another example is the congestion charge scheme in london, which aims to reduce traffic and air pollution in the city center. the scheme requires drivers to pay a daily fee to enter the designated zone during the peak hours, and uses cameras and license plate recognition to enforce the charge. the scheme is monitored and evaluated by the transport for london, which also invests the revenue from the charge in improving public transport and cycling infrastructure. these examples show how temporary targets and supervisory institutions can help monitor and control the levels of pollutants and enforce the relevant regulations.",

      "Outcome4": "Providing more environmental education and information campaigns in schools, workplaces, and communities, to raise people's knowledge and understanding of the causes and effects of pollution and traffic problems, and the benefits of adopting more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyles and practices.",
      "Outcome5": "These solutions, however, may not be sufficient to tackle the root causes of pollution and traffic problems, which are often related to the urban planning and development patterns. therefore, in addition to the measures mentioned above, authorities should also consider adopting more holistic and long-term strategies to create a more sustainable and livable city. for instance, they could promote mixed-use development, which integrates residential, commercial, and recreational functions in a compact and walkable area, to reduce the need for long-distance commuting and car dependence. they could also enhance the green infrastructure, such as parks, gardens, and bike lanes, to provide more natural amenities and encourage low-carbon modes of transportation. moreover, they could involve the public and the stakeholders in the decision-making process, to ensure that the policies and plans reflect the needs and preferences of the community and foster a sense of ownership and responsibility.",
      "Outcome6": "However, these solutions are not enough to tackle the root causes of pollution and traffic problems, which lie in the unsustainable patterns of production and consumption in modern society. therefore, more radical and long-term measures are also needed to address these issues."

      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, capital punishment is a controversial topic that has both supporters and opponents. some argue that it is a just and deterrent measure that prevents further crimes and expresses the society's condemnation of heinous acts. others contend that it is a flawed and inhumane practice that can result in wrongful convictions and disregard the circumstances of the offenders. the jury should carefully examine the evidence and the motives of the criminals before deciding their fate. capital punishment should only be applied to the most deserving and culpable cases, where there is no doubt of guilt and no possibility of reform.",
      "Outcome5": "Capital punishment can deter potential offenders from committing heinous crimes by instilling fear of the ultimate penalty. however, not all crimes are equally deserving of such a harsh punishment. the jury should consider the context and motive of the crime, and differentiate between intentional and accidental or defensive acts of violence. otherwise, they might end up sentencing an innocent or unjustly accused person to death, which would be a grave injustice and a violation of human rights.",
      "Outcome6": "While capital punishment may have a deterrent effect on some potential offenders, it also raises serious ethical and legal issues for the justice system. not only does it involve taking away a person's life, but it also relies on the accuracy and fairness of the jury's decision."

      "Outcome2": "However, these arguments do not take into account the benefits of online-degrees for many students who face various challenges in attending lectures in person. online-degrees offer flexibility and convenience for students who have other commitments, such as work, family, or health issues, or live far from campus. they can access the course materials and assignments at any time and pace that suits their needs and preferences. they can also interact with teachers and classmates through online platforms, such as forums, chats, or video calls, and participate in collaborative learning activities. online-degrees can also expose students to diverse perspectives and cultures from different regions and countries.",
      "Outcome3": "However, supporters of online-degrees could counter that the lack of face-to-face interaction does not necessarily imply a lower quality of education or a diminished sense of community. they could point to the various technological tools and platforms that enable online students to communicate and collaborate with their instructors and peers, such as video conferencing, online forums, chat rooms, and social media. they could also argue that online-degrees offer more flexibility and convenience for students who have other commitments or preferences, such as work, family, or travel. moreover, they could claim that online-degrees expose students to a more diverse and global perspective, as they can interact with people from different backgrounds and cultures.",
      "Outcome4": "However, this counterargument overlooks the fact that online-degrees can also foster communication and collaboration among students and teachers through various technologies and platforms. for instance, online students can use video conferencing, chat rooms, forums, and social media to interact with their instructors and peers in real time or asynchronously. they can also participate in group projects, case studies, simulations, and online communities of practice that enhance their learning and engagement. moreover, online-degrees can offer students access to a wider and more diverse network of experts, mentors, and fellow learners from different backgrounds, disciplines, and locations. therefore, online-degrees do not necessarily compromise the quality and richness of the educational experience.",
      "Outcome5": "However, the benefits of online-degrees are not without drawbacks. nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. they further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. it is the real interactions and communications in class that make education much more attractive. in contrast, online-degrees may limit the chances of developing social and interpersonal skills, as well as creating a sense of belonging and community among learners. moreover, some online courses may lack the quality and rigor of face-to-face instruction, and may not be recognized or accredited by some employers or institutions.",
      "Outcome6": "However, these arguments do not take into account the advantages of online-degrees for students who face various challenges or limitations in accessing traditional education. for instance, online-degrees can offer more flexibility and convenience for students who have work or family commitments, who live in remote or rural areas, or who have physical or mental disabilities. moreover, online-degrees can also foster communication and collaboration among students and teachers through various digital tools and platforms, such as video conferencing, online forums, and social media. therefore, online-degrees do not necessarily imply a loss of quality or engagement in education, but rather a different and innovative way of learning."

      "Outcome2": "One of the reasons why i agree with the statement that people should work faster and more riskily is that it helps them gain more skills by studying. in today's competitive world, having a higher education or a specialized qualification can open many doors and opportunities for career advancement. however, pursuing further studies often requires a lot of time, effort, and money, which may not be available for everyone. therefore, by working faster and more riskily, people can save more money and time to invest in their education and improve their knowledge and abilities. for instance, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, i am working in two organizations to gain more salary. the more money, the more chances.",
      "Outcome3": "Another reason why i agree with the statement that people should work faster and more riskily is that it allows them to have more than one job. in today's competitive and expensive world, working in a single organization may not be enough to meet one's financial needs and goals. therefore, many people choose to work in two or three firms in a week, even if it means sacrificing their leisure time and facing more stress. by doing so, they can earn more money and pursue their dreams, such as studying abroad or buying a house. for instance, i am currently working in two organizations to save enough money for applying to study abroad, which is a long-term investment in my education and career. the more money i earn, the more opportunities i have.",
      "Outcome4": "Another reason why i agree with the statement is that working faster enables people to handle more tasks in a given time. this can improve their efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness in the fast-changing market. for instance, by working faster, i can finish my assignments in the morning and then devote the afternoon to learning a new language or skill. this way, i can enhance my resume and increase my chances of getting a better job or scholarship. handling more tasks is the third benefit of working faster, even if it is more risky.",
      "Outcome5": "Working in multiple firms in a week is one of the ways that people try to cope with the rising expenses and achieve their goals. however, this is not the only reason that people should work faster and take more risks. there are other advantages that can result from this approach, as i will explain in the following paragraph.",
      "Outcome6": "However, working faster and taking more risks also has some drawbacks that should not be ignored. for instance, it can cause stress, burnout, health problems, and lower quality of work. moreover, it can reduce the satisfaction and loyalty of workers, as well as their opportunities for creativity and innovation. therefore, people should balance their work speed and risk level with their personal and professional goals, values, and well-being."

As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.",
      "Right": "Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them."

      "Outcome2": "Traditional skills and lifestyles are not only the heritage of a nation or a culture, but also the source of inspiration and creativity for the present and the future. however, many of them are facing the threat of extinction due to the rapid development of technology, which often replaces or marginalizes them. for instance, the craftsmanship of pottery, weaving, carving, and embroidery, which reflect the aesthetic and artistic expression of different communities, are losing their market and appeal to the younger generations who prefer mass-produced or digital products. similarly, the lifestyles of nomads, farmers, hunters, and fishers, which are based on the harmony and adaptation to the natural environment, are being disrupted by the urbanization, industrialization, and globalization that impose new demands and challenges. these traditional skills and lifestyles are valuable because they enrich the diversity and identity of humanity, preserve the ecological and cultural balance, and offer alternative and sustainable ways of living and working.",
      "Outcome3": "However, not everyone agrees with the necessity of preserving the traditional skills and lifestyles in the face of technological advancement. some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the income it generates. they may argue that the government should prioritize more profitable and innovative sectors that can boost the economy and enhance the competitiveness of the country. moreover, they may claim that the traditional skills and lifestyles are outdated and irrelevant to the modern society and the needs of the people. these people may disregard the cultural and historical significance of the traditions and the diversity and richness they bring to the society.",
      "Outcome4": "However, this argument overlooks the broader benefits of protecting traditions for the society and culture. traditions are not only a source of income, but also a way of preserving the identity, diversity and heritage of different groups and communities. according to a report by unesco, safeguarding intangible cultural heritage, such as traditional skills and lifestyles, can contribute to social cohesion, intercultural dialogue and sustainable development. moreover, traditions can also inspire creativity and innovation, as well as provide opportunities for learning and exchange. for example, a study by the smithsonian institution found that traditional crafts and arts, such as weaving, pottery and music, can enhance the cognitive, emotional and social skills of children and adults. therefore, protecting traditions is not a waste of resources, but a valuable investment for the future.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the main reasons why i believe that traditions should be valued and paid attention to is that they represent the cultural heritage and identity of a nation or a community. traditional skills and lifestyles are not only the products of historical accumulation and adaptation, but also the sources of inspiration and creativity for the present and the future generations. by protecting and preserving them, we can enrich our cultural diversity and promote mutual respect and understanding among different groups of people. moreover, traditional skills and lifestyles can also offer alternative solutions and perspectives to some of the challenges and problems that we face in the modern world, such as environmental degradation, social alienation, and spiritual emptiness.",

      "Outcome2": "The ability to adapt oneself to the new environment is part of the job because it enables one to perform better and achieve the goals of the organization. for example, a worker who can adjust to different cultures, expectations, and norms of the workplace can build rapport with colleagues, clients, and stakeholders, and avoid misunderstandings and conflicts. moreover, a worker who can adapt to changing situations, such as new technologies, policies, or challenges, can demonstrate flexibility, creativity, and resilience, and cope with stress and uncertainty. therefore, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment is a valuable skill that can enhance one's professional development and career prospects.",
      "Outcome3": "Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. this ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. however, adapting to the environment is not enough to ensure success in one's career. working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. therefore, one should not neglect the importance of developing one's skills and expertise in the field, as they are the foundation of one's performance and reputation.",
      "Outcome4": "Although adapting to a new environment is important for communication and cooperation, working alone has its own advantages for a job. working alone allows one to focus on the tasks at hand, develop one's skills and expertise, and avoid distractions and conflicts that may arise from teamwork. working alone also requires a high level of knowledge of the job, as one has to rely on oneself to solve problems, make decisions, and manage time. therefore, working alone is a more lasting and rewarding aspect of a job than adapting to a new environment, which may be temporary and superficial. however, working alone does not mean isolating oneself from others, as one still needs to communicate and cooperate with other workers when necessary, and learn from their feedback and suggestions. thus, a balance between working alone and working with others is essential for a successful career.",
      "Outcome5": "Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. this ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. however, adapting to the surroundings is not the only skill that matters in the workplace. working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. therefore, one should not neglect the importance of mastering the professional and technical aspects of one's role, as they are the basis of one's performance and reputation.",
      "Outcome6": "However, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment is not the only factor that determines one's success in a job. in fact, it may be less important than having the relevant skills and knowledge that are required for the specific tasks and challenges that one faces in the workplace. working alone, for instance, demands a high level of self-discipline, motivation, and problem-solving skills, which cannot be easily acquired or replaced by being adaptable. therefore, while being adaptable is a valuable quality, it should not overshadow the need for professional competence and expertise."

      "Outcome2": "Landscape painting and architectural engineering are very different fields of work, requiring different skills, knowledge, and creativity. landscape painting is a form of art that captures the natural scenery and beauty of the environment, often using various techniques and materials to express the artist's vision and feelings. architectural engineering, on the other hand, is a form of engineering that applies scientific and technical principles to design, construct, and maintain buildings and structures, often following strict codes and standards to ensure safety and functionality. while both fields can be rewarding and challenging, they also have different demands and expectations from the workers and the society.",
      "Outcome3": "My father's decision to switch his career from an architectural engineer to a landscape painter was not a rash or impulsive one, but a reflection of his personal values and preferences. he had always loved painting and nature, and he felt that he had reached a point in his life where he wanted to pursue his passion and creativity, rather than continue doing the same work for 20 years. he believed that doing different tasks would make him happier and more fulfilled, and he was willing to take the risk and face the challenges of changing his profession. however, his choice also affected our family life in various ways. my mother, who had supported him for so long, was worried about our financial stability and his future prospects. she often argued with him about his job, and tried to persuade him to go back to engineering or find a more stable and lucrative occupation. i, on the other hand, admired his courage and determination, and supported his dream. i also enjoyed seeing his paintings and learning from his artistic skills and insights. i understood that doing different tasks was not only a matter of personal happiness, but also a way of learning, growing, and expressing oneself.",
      "Outcome4": "My father's decision to pursue his passion for painting reflects a psychological need for variety and challenge in his work. according to the self-determination theory, people are motivated by three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. autonomy refers to the sense of having control and choice over one's actions, competence refers to the sense of being able to master one's skills and tasks, and relatedness refers to the sense of belonging and connection with others. doing the same task for 20 years can undermine these needs, especially autonomy and competence, and lead to boredom, frustration, and dissatisfaction. on the other hand, doing different tasks can enhance these needs, especially autonomy and competence, and lead to curiosity, interest, and satisfaction. for example, a study by wrzesniewski and dutton (2001) found that hospital cleaners who crafted their jobs by adding variety and meaning to their tasks reported higher levels of motivation, well-being, and performance than those who followed the prescribed routines. similarly, a study by grant and parker (2009) found that job crafting, or the proactive shaping of one's job to align with one's values, strengths, and passions, increased employees' happiness, engagement, and productivity. therefore, doing different tasks can make employees and employers much happier, as they can experience more autonomy, competence, and relatedness in their work.",
      "Outcome5": "My father's decision to pursue a different career path was not only a personal choice, but also a reflection of a broader trend in the modern workplace. many studies and surveys have shown that doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier, as they can avoid boredom, burnout, and stagnation. (connect the left text and the right text by linking the father's example to the general claim)",
      "Outcome6": "My father's decision to pursue a different career path may seem irrational to some, but it reflects his desire for more variety and creativity in his work. he is not alone in this preference, as many studies have shown that doing different tasks can enhance the well-being and performance of both employees and employers. here are some of the reasons why doing different tasks makes them much happier."

      "Outcome1": "One of the debates in higher education is whether professors should focus more on teaching or research. some people argue that teaching is the primary responsibility of professors, as they are expected to impart knowledge and skills to their students. others contend that research is equally or more important, as it contributes to the advancement of science and society. this essay will examine both sides of this issue and present some arguments for and against each position. to begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. the professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. if professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. the reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. in this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.",
      "Outcome2": "There is empirical evidence that professors' research activities may affect their teaching quality negatively. for example, a study by hattie and marsh (1996) found that there was a negative relationship between research productivity and teaching effectiveness across 58 studies involving more than 13,000 academics. they suggested that research and teaching compete for the limited time and resources of professors, and that the reward system in academia favors research over teaching. another study by stack (2016) examined the impact of research grants on teaching evaluations of 1,300 professors in canada. he found that professors who received more research funding had lower teaching ratings than those who received less or none, and that this effect was stronger for junior than senior professors. these studies indicate that professors' research activities may compromise their ability or motivation to provide well-preparation courses to their students.",
      "Outcome3": "However, this does not mean that professors' research has no value or relevance for students and society. on the contrary, professors' research can also enhance their teaching by bringing new insights, perspectives, and discoveries to the classroom. moreover, professors' research can contribute to the advancement of science, technology, culture, and public policy, which can benefit the wider community and address global challenges. therefore, professors' research can also be seen as a form of service and responsibility to their academic fields and society.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, i believe that professors should focus more on teaching students than on conducting research. teaching is the primary responsibility of professors, and it requires them to design high-quality courses that impart the latest knowledge and skills to students. research, on the other hand, may distract professors from their educational mission and compromise the effectiveness of their instruction. by prioritizing teaching over research, professors can better fulfill their role as educators and mentors for the next generation of scholars and professionals.",
      "Outcome5": "However, some people may argue that professors should also focus on research, as it is an essential part of their academic career and contribution to society. they may claim that research can help professors update their knowledge, discover new insights, and enhance their reputation and influence in their fields. moreover, research can also benefit students, as they can learn from their professors' findings, participate in research projects, and develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. thus, research is not a distraction, but a complement to teaching, and professors should balance both aspects of their work.",
      "Outcome6": "However, teaching students effectively is not the only responsibility of professors. research is also an essential part of their academic work, and it can benefit both themselves and their students in various ways."

Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production.

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "One of the reasons why poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries in trade is that they lack the resources and skills to produce competitive goods and services that can meet the demand and standards of the global market. poorer countries often face challenges such as low productivity, limited innovation, weak institutions, and environmental degradation that hamper their economic development and diversification. richer countries, on the other hand, have more access to capital, technology, education, and research that enable them to create and maintain a comparative advantage in various sectors. therefore, poorer countries need not only financial assistance, but also technical assistance and capacity building from richer countries to improve their trade performance and potential.",
      "Outcome2": "This situation of low trading activity in poorer countries has negative impacts on their economic development and poverty reduction. according to the world bank, the average trade-to-gdp ratio of low-income countries was only 47% in 2019, compared to 72% for high-income countries. this means that low-income countries are less integrated into the global market and have fewer opportunities to benefit from trade. moreover, incomplete transportation infrastructure hinders the movement of goods and people within and across borders, increasing the costs and risks of doing business. for instance, a study by the african development bank found that the average cost of transporting a container from mombasa to kampala was $2,500, more than twice the cost of shipping the same container from shanghai to mombasa. these factors limit the potential of trade to generate income, employment, and growth for poorer countries.",
      "Outcome3": "By providing financial service and consultation, richer countries can help poorer countries to improve their trading activities and outcomes in several ways. first, financial service can enable poorer countries to access credit, insurance, and savings that can facilitate their participation in domestic and international markets. this can help them to diversify their products, increase their competitiveness, and reduce their vulnerability to shocks. second, consultation can help poorer countries to design and implement a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure that can support trading. this can help them to lower their transport costs, expand their market access, and enhance their connectivity. therefore, financial service and consultation from richer countries can be beneficial for both the development and the integration of poorer countries in the area of trade.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, it is clear that richer nations have a moral obligation to help poorer countries in terms of health, education and trade. by sharing their resources, expertise and technology, they can contribute to the well-being and development of the less fortunate nations. this will not only reduce the gap between rich and poor, but also promote global peace and cooperation. therefore, i strongly agree that the developed world should assist the developing world in various ways.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, it is clear that richer nations have a responsibility to help poorer nations in various aspects, such as education, health, and trade. by doing so, they can not only contribute to the global development and stability, but also foster a more equitable and harmonious world. however, the assistance from richer nations should not be imposed or exploited, but rather based on mutual respect and cooperation. poorer nations should also strive to improve their own capacities and potentials, and not rely solely on external aid. only then, can the gap between the rich and the poor be narrowed and the benefits of globalization be shared by all.",
      "Outcome6": "However, trade is not the only aspect of development that poorer countries need to improve. another crucial factor is education, which can empower people to acquire skills, knowledge, and opportunities for a better future. unfortunately, many poorer countries face challenges in providing quality and accessible education for their citizens, especially for girls and marginalized groups."

      "Left": "Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.",
      "Right": "Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "One of the benefits of technology for public is that it enhances the quality and efficiency of telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings. for example, technology enables us to communicate faster and cheaper with people across the world, using various devices and platforms, such as mobile phones, email, social media, and video conferencing. technology also allows us to produce more goods and services with less resources and waste, using automation, robotics, artificial intelligence, and green technologies. furthermore, technology improves the design and construction of buildings, making them more safe, comfortable, and sustainable, using advanced materials, engineering, and architecture. these technological innovations not only benefit the public by providing them with more options and opportunities, but also by creating more jobs and income for the workers and entrepreneurs involved in these sectors.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the reasons why i disagree with the opinion that technology has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor is that technology has reduced the cost and increased the quality of many fields that are essential for human well-being and development. for example, technology has enabled the production of cheaper and more efficient energy sources, such as solar and wind power, which can benefit both the environment and the people who rely on them. technology has also improved the health care system, by providing more advanced and accessible diagnostic and treatment methods, such as telemedicine and artificial intelligence, which can save lives and reduce inequalities. technology has also enhanced the education sector, by offering more diverse and flexible learning opportunities, such as online courses and digital libraries, which can increase the access and quality of education for people from different backgrounds and locations. these are just some of the examples of how technology has contributed to the improvement of various fields that affect our daily lives.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the reasons why i disagree with the view that technology widens the gap between rich and poor is that it has a positive effect on the living standards and opportunities of both groups. for example, technological innovations in health care, education, transportation and entertainment have increased the quality and quantity of services and products that people can access and enjoy. these improvements not only benefit the wealthy, but also the poor, who can benefit from lower costs, higher efficiency and more choices. furthermore, technology can empower the poor by providing them with tools and platforms to communicate, learn, work and participate in social and economic activities. technology can also help to reduce poverty and inequality by creating new markets, jobs and income sources for the poor, as well as by enhancing their skills and capabilities. therefore, technology can be seen as a positive force that can improve the well-being and opportunities of both rich and poor people.",
      "Outcome4": "First of all, i believe that technology is not the main cause of the gap between rich and poor, but rather a tool that can be used for different purposes. technology itself does not create inequality, but it depends on how people use it, and how the society distributes its benefits and costs. for example, some technologies can help to reduce poverty, improve health and education, and empower marginalized groups, while others can be used to exploit, oppress, and exclude people. therefore, the problem is not technology, but the social and economic system that shapes its development and application. secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. with the development of internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. in the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. in addition, the internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the reasons why i disagree with the opinion that technology widens the gap between rich and poor is that technology provides more opportunities for education and innovation. technology enables people to access various sources of knowledge and skills, such as online courses, e-books, podcasts, and digital tools. these resources can help people to enhance their human capital and creativity, and to pursue their personal and professional goals. furthermore, technology fosters a culture of entrepreneurship and collaboration, where people can create new products and services, and share their ideas and solutions with others. technology, therefore, can empower people to overcome the barriers of distance, time, and cost, and to participate in the global economy and society.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the reasons why i disagree with the opinion that technology increases the gap between rich and poor is that technology can actually reduce the costs of many goods and services that are essential for human well-being. for example, thanks to technology, we can enjoy cheaper and more efficient health care, education, transportation and communication, which can enhance our quality of life and opportunities. technology can also create new markets and industries that can generate more income and employment for people from different backgrounds and skills. therefore, technology can be a powerful tool for social and economic development, rather than a source of division and exclusion."

The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.",

For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "One of the main arguments against the idea of relying on tv as a learning tool is that it deprives children of the benefits of traditional education. traditional education, which involves attending classes, doing homework, reading books, and interacting with teachers and peers, has been proven to be effective in developing various cognitive, social, and emotional skills. moreover, traditional education exposes children to a wide range of subjects, perspectives, and experiences that can enrich their knowledge and curiosity. therefore, it is preferable to have students spend more time on traditional education than on tv.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the benefits of traditional education is that it fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills in children. unlike watching tv, which often provides ready-made information and opinions, traditional education requires students to engage with various sources of knowledge, analyze arguments, and construct their own responses. for example, in a classroom setting, students can discuss different perspectives on a topic, debate with their peers, and write essays that demonstrate their understanding and reasoning. these skills are essential for developing a sense of curiosity, independence, and responsibility, as well as for preparing them for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.",
      "Outcome3": "Traditional education methods, such as reading, writing, speaking, listening, and problem-solving, can cater to different types of learners and foster their cognitive, linguistic, and social development. for example, reading books can enhance vocabulary, comprehension, and imagination; writing essays can improve communication, organization, and critical thinking; speaking and listening can promote oral expression, interaction, and feedback; and problem-solving can stimulate creativity, logic, and collaboration. these methods can also expose children to diverse topics, perspectives, and cultures, enriching their knowledge and curiosity. therefore, traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method.",
      "Outcome4": "One of the drawbacks of watching tv for learning is that it can affect children's attention span and memory. tv programs often have fast-paced, flashy, and distracting elements that can reduce the ability of children to focus and retain information. moreover, watching tv does not require active engagement or interaction, which are essential for deep and meaningful learning. children who watch tv for long hours may also miss out on opportunities to practice and apply their knowledge in different contexts and situations. therefore, watching tv is not a suitable substitute for traditional education, which has its stand for most appropriate method.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the main drawbacks of learning by watching tv is that it deprives children of the opportunity to engage in more active and interactive forms of education. traditional education, despite its possible flaws, offers a variety of ways to stimulate children's curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking through classroom discussions, experiments, projects, and field trips. these methods not only enhance children's knowledge, but also develop their social and emotional skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. therefore, spending more time on tvs may limit children's exposure to such beneficial educational experiences.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main drawbacks of relying on television as a learning tool is that it deprives children of the benefits of traditional education, which involves interaction with teachers and peers, exposure to diverse subjects and perspectives, and development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. traditional education has its stand for the most appropriate method because it fosters a holistic and balanced growth of an individual, not only in terms of knowledge, but also in terms of social, emotional, and physical well-being. therefore, physical inactivity should not be discouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills. secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it."

Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.",

      "Outcome2": "Some people may argue that zoos have educational and conservation benefits for both humans and animals. however, i disagree with this view for several reasons. first, zoos can not provide adequate and authentic information about the natural behaviors and characteristics of wild animals, as they are often confined in unnatural and stressful conditions. therefore, zoos may mislead the public and create a false impression of wildlife. second, zoos can not effectively conserve endangered species, as they often breed animals for commercial and entertainment purposes, rather than for restoring their populations in the wild. furthermore, zoos may interfere with the genetic diversity and adaptation of animals, as they are exposed to artificial selection and inbreeding. third, zoos can not justify the ethical and moral issues of depriving animals of their freedom and dignity, as they are subjected to human domination and exploitation. hence, zoos may violate the intrinsic value and rights of animals as sentient beings.",
      "Outcome3": "However, some people may argue that zoos are beneficial for wild animals in several ways. for instance, they may claim that zoos provide animals with food, medical care, and protection from predators and poachers. they may also contend that zoos have educational and scientific value, as they allow people to learn more about animal behavior and conservation, and conduct research on endangered species. yet, these arguments are not convincing or valid for several reasons. first, zoos often fail to meet the basic needs and preferences of animals, such as adequate space, social interaction, and environmental enrichment. second, zoos may cause more harm than good to animal welfare, as they expose animals to stress, boredom, and disease. third, zoos may undermine the conservation efforts, as they reduce the genetic diversity and the survival skills of animals, and divert resources and attention from the protection of natural habitats. therefore, zoos are not the best solution for preserving and respecting wild animals.",
      "Outcome4": "Therefore, keeping wild animals in zoos is not only unethical but also harmful for their well-being. zoos deprive animals of their natural instincts, social bonds, and environmental diversity, and expose them to stress, boredom, and diseases. instead of confining animals in cages and enclosures, we should respect their dignity and autonomy, and support conservation efforts that protect their habitats and populations in the wild. how can we claim to love and care for animals when we rob them of their essence and identity?",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, keeping wild animals in zoos is not a humane or effective way of preserving biodiversity and wildlife conservation. zoos deprive animals of their natural rights and cause them physical and psychological harm. instead of confining animals in cages and enclosures, we should respect their autonomy and dignity and protect their habitats from human interference and destruction.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, keeping wild animals in zoos is not a humane or effective way of conserving them. on the contrary, it deprives them of their natural instincts, behaviors, and social interactions, which are essential for their well-being and survival. zoos also fail to educate the public about the real needs and challenges of wild animals, and instead present a distorted and simplified image of their lives. rather than supporting zoos, we should support efforts to protect and restore the natural habitats of wild animals, and to reduce the human impacts that threaten their existence."

Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.",

      "Outcome1": "Compassion can benefit both the giver and the receiver in various ways. for the giver, compassion can enhance one's sense of well-being, happiness, and gratitude, as well as foster positive relationships and social bonds. for the receiver, compassion can alleviate suffering, provide hope and dignity, and empower them to overcome challenges and pursue their goals. moreover, compassion can create a ripple effect of kindness and generosity, as the receiver may in turn help others in need, or express gratitude and appreciation to the giver. thus, compassion can enrich the lives of both parties and contribute to a more harmonious and humane society.",
      "Outcome2": "However, compassion is not the only motive that should drive wealthy nations to assist those who suffer from hunger and deprivation. there are also practical and strategic reasons why such generosity is beneficial for both the giver and the receiver. by sharing their resources and expertise, rich countries can foster goodwill, stability, and cooperation among the less fortunate regions of the world. they can also prevent or mitigate the negative impacts of global problems such as conflicts, epidemics, and environmental degradation, which affect everyone regardless of their location or income. furthermore, they can create new opportunities for trade, investment, and innovation by tapping into the potential and diversity of the developing world.",
      "Outcome3": "Helping the poor and hungry is not only a matter of ethics, but also of prudence and foresight. by sharing their resources and expertise, wealthy nations can improve the living conditions and prospects of millions of people who otherwise would face despair and violence. this, in turn, can enhance the global security, health, and trade, as poverty and famine are often the root causes of conflicts, diseases, and instability. by fostering compassion and cooperation, wealthy nations can also build trust and goodwill with other countries and cultures, which can facilitate diplomatic and economic relations. thus, helping the needy is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways.",
      "Outcome4": "To watch the suffering of others and do nothing is not only unethical, but also foolish. by sharing their resources and expertise, rich countries can foster goodwill, cooperation, and peace among the nations of the world. they can also benefit from the development and innovation that can arise from alleviating poverty and hunger. compassion is not only a noble virtue, but also a wise strategy for human progress. therefore, i argue that wealthy nations have a moral and practical obligation to help the poor and the hungry.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, it is the duty of the affluent countries to share their resources and expertise with the less fortunate ones, who are suffering from hunger and deprivation. by doing so, they are not only fulfilling their ethical obligations, but also investing in a more peaceful and stable world. in summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is the duty of the rich countries to share their resources and expertise with the poor ones, not only to alleviate their suffering, but also to foster a sense of global solidarity and cooperation. by helping the less fortunate, they are not only fulfilling their ethical obligations, but also investing in their own future security and prosperity. as the world becomes more interconnected and interdependent, the problems of one region can affect the others, and the solutions of one region can benefit the others."

      "Outcome2": "The benefits of using technology or advanced facilities to prepare food are not only theoretical, but also supported by empirical data. according to a study by the food and agriculture organization, using ozone machines can reduce the microbial load and pesticide residues of fresh produce by up to 90%, while preserving the sensory and nutritional qualities (fao, 2016). another study by the university of illinois found that microwave cooking can retain more vitamin c, folate, and antioxidants in broccoli than boiling or steaming (zhang and hamouz, 2012). moreover, a survey by the national restaurant association revealed that 78% of consumers say that food safety and quality are the most important factors when choosing a restaurant, and 68% of restaurants use technology to monitor and improve their food safety practices (nra, 2019). therefore, using technology or advanced facilities can save time and ensure nutrition and quality of food, without compromising the taste and satisfaction of the consumers.",
      "Outcome3": "Cooking food by oneself and using technology or advanced facilities are two different ways of preparing meals for one's family. each way has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the preferences, resources, and circumstances of the cook. cooking food by oneself can ensure nutrition and quality of food, as well as provide a sense of satisfaction and creativity. however, it can also be time-consuming, exhausting, and costly, especially for busy people who have to balance work, family, and other responsibilities. using technology or advanced facilities, on the other hand, can save time, energy, and money, as well as offer convenience and variety. for example, using an ozone machine can eliminate harmful substances from food, and ordering food from a restaurant can cater to different tastes and dietary needs. however, using technology or advanced facilities can also pose some risks, such as losing control over the ingredients, quality, and freshness of food, or relying too much on external sources and losing the skills and traditions of cooking. therefore, the best way of preparing meals for one's family may depend on the situation and the goals of the cook.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, the idea that spending more time on cooking food is the only way to ensure nutrition and quality for one's family is not convincing. technology and advanced facilities can help preserve and enhance the food's value, while eating out can also be a safe and satisfying option, as long as the restaurants follow the quality standards. therefore, the readers should not feel guilty or stressed about not having enough time to cook food, but rather look for ways to optimize their time management and food choices. some suggestions are to plan ahead the weekly menu, use online delivery services or smart appliances, or explore different cuisines and dishes that are both healthy and delicious. by doing so, the readers can enjoy the benefits of food without sacrificing their other priorities and interests.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, the claim that spending much time in cooking food is the only way to ensure nutrition and quality of food for one's family is not convincing. technology and advanced facilities can also help to preserve and enhance the food's benefits, as well as to eliminate harmful substances. moreover, eating out at restaurants is not necessarily a bad choice, as long as they follow the standards and regulations of food safety and hygiene. hence, people can save time and enjoy a variety of dishes without compromising their health and well-being.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, the claim that spending much time in cooking food is necessary for nutrition and quality is not convincing. there are other ways to ensure that the food we consume is healthy and safe, without sacrificing our precious time and energy. in fact, using technology or advanced facilities can enhance the benefits of food and make it more convenient and accessible."

      "Outcome1": "Health is one of the most valuable assets that people can have, and it is influenced by various factors, such as diet, exercise, environment and personal choices. therefore, it is essential that people learn how to take care of their health from an early age, and that education plays a key role in this process. in this essay, i will argue that health lessons should be included in school programmes, especially at primary level, in order to raise people's awareness and foster healthy habits. no one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. what is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.",
      "Outcome2": "Some evidence or examples to support the argument that health lessons are important in school programmes can be drawn from various sources. for instance, a study by the world health organization (who) found that health education in schools can improve students' knowledge, attitudes and skills related to nutrition, physical activity, hygiene and mental health, and reduce the risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and other chronic conditions (who, 2018). another example is the health promoting schools (hps) initiative, which is a holistic approach that integrates health education with school policies, environment, partnerships and services to create a healthy and supportive learning community (lee et al., 2016). hps has been implemented in many countries and regions, such as australia, canada, china, europe and the pacific, and has shown positive outcomes in terms of students' health, academic performance, social and emotional well-being and civic engagement (lee et al., 2016).",
      "Outcome3": "No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. what is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants. however, health education alone is not enough to prevent or reduce the risks of various diseases and disorders that may affect children and adults alike. therefore, another essential aspect of promoting health and well-being is physical activity.",
      "Outcome4": "Besides providing children with basic knowledge of health and nutrition, health lessons can also have positive effects on their physical and mental well-being. by learning about the benefits of regular exercise, proper hygiene, and stress management, children can develop healthy habits that can prevent various diseases and disorders in the future. moreover, health lessons can also foster children's self-esteem, confidence, and social skills, as they can learn to appreciate their own bodies, respect others' choices, and cooperate with their peers in group activities. therefore, health lessons can help children to grow up as well-rounded and responsible individuals.",
      "Outcome5": "One way to implement health lessons in school programmes is to incorporate physical activities and exercises into the curriculum. by doing so, children can not only learn about the benefits of staying fit and active, but also practice them on a regular basis. physical activities and exercises can help children improve their cardiovascular health, strengthen their muscles and bones, enhance their coordination and balance, and reduce their stress and anxiety levels. moreover, they can also foster children's social skills, teamwork, and self-confidence, as they interact with their peers and teachers in various sports and games. therefore, physical activities and exercises are essential components of health education that can complement the knowledge and skills that children acquire from learning about balanced diets and nutritious food.",
      "Outcome6": "Besides educating children about food choices, health lessons in school programmes should also cover other aspects of physical and mental well-being. for example, they should learn about the benefits of regular exercise, proper hygiene, stress management and positive relationships. these topics can help children develop skills and attitudes that will enable them to cope with various challenges and opportunities in life. moreover, by fostering a culture of health and wellness in schools, teachers and parents can also set good examples and reinforce the messages conveyed in the curriculum."

Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the \"weaker\" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.",
      "Right": "Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society because it is not only a matter of human rights, but also a source of social progress and economic growth. women, who make up half of the population, have the potential and the aspiration to participate in various fields of endeavor and to demonstrate their talents and creativity. by empowering women and ensuring their equal opportunities and treatment, society can benefit from their diverse perspectives, skills and contributions. moreover, fairness between males and females can also foster a culture of respect, cooperation and mutual understanding, which can enhance the quality of life and the harmony of the society.",
      "Outcome2": "Women have contributed to the development of human beings in different fields in various ways. for example, women have made remarkable achievements in literature, arts, education, medicine, law, and human rights. some notable women who have left their mark on history include jane austen, frida kahlo, marie curie, rosa parks, malala yousafzai, and ruth bader ginsburg. these women and many others have demonstrated their creativity, intelligence, courage, and leadership in the face of challenges and discrimination. they have also inspired and empowered other women and girls to pursue their dreams and aspirations.",
      "Outcome3": "However, the increasing equality between men and women does not mean that they have to abandon their distinctive roles and responsibilities in the family and society. on the contrary, it means that they have to cooperate and complement each other in order to achieve a harmonious and prosperous life. for example, studies have shown that couples who share household chores and child care are more satisfied and less stressed than those who adhere to traditional gender norms. moreover, children who grow up in families where both parents are involved and supportive tend to have better academic, social and emotional outcomes than those who lack parental guidance or attention. therefore, it is not the equality itself that causes problems, but the lack of communication, understanding and flexibility among family members.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, the essay has discussed the fairness between males and females in the modern society and how it affects various aspects of life. it has argued that women have the right and the ability to participate in different fields and achieve their goals, while acknowledging some of the challenges and drawbacks that come with this change. to cope with these issues, women need to find effective ways to balance their work and family responsibilities, and to seek support from their partners, employers, and society. moreover, men and women should respect each other's choices and roles, and work together to create a more harmonious and equitable society.",
      "Outcome5": "However, the pursuit of fairness between males and females does not mean that they can ignore the differences and responsibilities that exist between them. in fact, achieving gender equality requires not only the empowerment of women, but also the respect and cooperation of men. both genders need to recognize and appreciate each other's roles and contributions in various aspects of life, and support each other in fulfilling their potential and overcoming their challenges. only by doing so can they create a harmonious and sustainable society that benefits everyone.",
      "Outcome6": "However, the fairness between males and females does not mean that they have to be identical in every aspect of life. there are still some natural differences and social expectations that affect their choices and responsibilities. for instance, women are more likely to bear the burden of childbearing and rearing, which may limit their career opportunities or require them to sacrifice some personal interests. men, on the other hand, may face more pressure to be the breadwinners and providers of the family, which may reduce their involvement in domestic affairs or emotional support. therefore, achieving a harmonious and respectful relationship between the two genders requires not only legal and institutional measures, but also mutual understanding and compromise."

      "Right": "First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them."

      "Outcome1": "Many people consider their pets as more than just animals, but as true friends who provide them with companionship, comfort, and support. pets can offer us a unique bond that is different from the one we have with other human beings, and they can enrich our lives in various ways. in this essay, i will argue that pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are, and i will provide some examples of how they can help us cope with loneliness, grief, and other challenges.",
      "Outcome2": "Having pets as friends can be very beneficial for our well-being, especially when we face difficult situations or emotions. pets can provide us with companionship, comfort, and support, as well as unconditional love and acceptance. they can also help us cope with stress, loneliness, and grief, as they are sensitive to our moods and needs. as the left text shows, pets can be more understanding and attentive than some human friends, and they can make us feel less isolated and hopeless. the right text will further explain how pets can also improve our physical health and happiness by encouraging us to exercise, socialize, and have fun.",
      "Outcome3": "Pets can offer emotional support and companionship in difficult times, such as grief or loneliness, because they can sense our emotions and provide comfort without judgment. unlike some human beings, who may not empathize with our situation or may offer unwanted advice or criticism, pets can simply be there for us and show us affection and loyalty. they can also distract us from our negative thoughts and feelings by engaging us in playful or relaxing activities, such as walking, playing, or cuddling. by doing so, they can help us cope with stress and sadness and improve our mood and well-being. therefore, pets can be our friends in a way that some people cannot.",
      "Outcome4": "Another way that pets can be our friends is by listening to us when we need to talk. sometimes, we may not find the right words to express our feelings or thoughts to other people, or we may fear being judged or misunderstood. in such situations, pets can offer us a safe and comforting outlet for our emotions. they can also help us to relax and reduce our stress levels by providing us with physical contact and affection. furthermore, pets can enhance our communication skills by making us more attentive and responsive to their needs and signals.",
      "Outcome5": "Another benefit of having pets is that they can improve our health and well-being. numerous studies have shown that pets can lower our blood pressure, reduce stress, enhance our mood, and boost our immunity. for example, stroking a cat or a dog can release oxytocin, a hormone that promotes bonding and relaxation. playing with a pet can also increase our physical activity and social interaction, which are essential for our mental and physical health. therefore, pets can be more than just companions; they can also be healers.",
      "Outcome6": "Another reason why pets are beneficial for us is that they can improve our health and well-being. as many studies have shown, having a pet can lower our blood pressure, reduce our stress and anxiety, and increase our physical activity and social interaction. for example, walking a dog every day can help us burn calories, strengthen our muscles, and meet new people who share our love for animals. likewise, cuddling a cat can release oxytocin, a hormone that promotes relaxation and bonding. therefore, pets can not only be our friends, but also our helpers in maintaining a healthy and happy lifestyle."

      "Outcome2": "The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. in a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. i agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in. a comparison between the situation of the modern artist and the labor who works in the merchandise factory illustrates this point. while the modern artist expresses his or her originality and creativity through a unique work of art that may appeal to a wide audience and earn a high price, the labor produces a hundred of 15 cm buddha temples a day that are identical and have a low value. the modern artist also enjoys more freedom and flexibility in his or her work, while the labor faces harsh and monotonous conditions. furthermore, the government cannot intervene in the market of art, which is based on subjective taste and preference, unlike the market of merchandise, which is regulated by supply and demand. therefore, the difference in income between the modern artist and the labor is not a matter of justice, but of nature.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the challenges and limitations of the government's role in addressing the income inequality in the field of art is that it would interfere with the market forces that determine the demand and supply of artistic products and services. the government cannot impose a standard price or wage for different forms of art, as they are influenced by various factors such as originality, popularity, quality, rarity, and cultural significance. the government also cannot regulate the artistic expression and creativity of the artists, as they are protected by the freedom of speech and the right to intellectual property. therefore, i agree with the critics who oppose government intervention, as it would violate the principles of artistic autonomy and diversity, and potentially harm the innovation and development of the field of art.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, the amount of money people earn in different fields of art and labor is often unfair, but the government should not intervene in this situation. the value of artistic creation depends on the taste and appreciation of the audience, not on the effort or skill of the creator. the government cannot impose a standard or a regulation on something that is subjective and diverse. instead, the government should focus on improving the working conditions and the welfare of the laborers, who deserve more respect and recognition for their hard work. the government should also promote the cultural diversity and the creativity of the artists, who contribute to the enrichment and the expression of the society. by doing so, the government can foster a more balanced and harmonious environment for both art and labor.",
      "Outcome5": "One reason why the government should not intervene in the income disparity between modern artists and laborers is that the nature of their work is different. modern artists produce original and creative works that reflect their personal expression and vision, and that appeal to a niche market of collectors and admirers. their income depends on the demand and appreciation of their art, which can vary widely and unpredictably. laborers, on the other hand, perform repetitive and standardized tasks that require physical effort and skill, but not much innovation or individuality. their income is determined by the supply and demand of their products, which are more common and predictable.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the reasons why some people think that the government should intervene in the income gap between artists and laborers is the perception of effort and skill involved in their work. they might argue that a modern artist who produces a single painting or sculpture that sells for millions of dollars does not work as hard or as skillfully as a laborer who produces hundreds of physical goods a day. however, this argument ignores the fact that artistic creation is not only a matter of manual labor, but also of creativity, originality, and expression. furthermore, it overlooks the different markets and demands that influence the prices of artworks and commodities."

      "Outcome5": "However, living in big cities also has some disadvantages that might affect children's development and well-being. for example, big cities are often crowded, noisy and polluted, which can cause stress, health problems and lack of natural environment for children. moreover, big cities can expose children to more social problems, such as crime, violence and inequality, which can harm their sense of security and morality. therefore, it is also important for children to experience the countryside, where they can enjoy more peace, fresh air and nature.",
      "Outcome6": "However, living in big cities also has some disadvantages that might affect children's well-being and development. firstly, big cities are often crowded, noisy and polluted, which can cause stress, health problems and lack of natural environment for children to enjoy. secondly, big cities are more competitive and demanding, which can put pressure on children to perform well academically and socially, and reduce their time for leisure and hobbies. thirdly, big cities are more diverse and complex, which can expose children to different cultures, values and lifestyles, but also to potential conflicts, dangers and temptations. therefore, it is not always easy for children to adapt and cope with the challenges and opportunities of urban life."

      "Outcome2": "Both the left text and the right text value friendship, but they have different opinions on how mistakes affect it. the left text argues that mistakes are not important and can be easily forgiven, because friendship lasts forever and nobody remembers them. the right text implies that mistakes can break friendship if they are big, because friendship is a gift that should not be wasted. i agree more with the right text, because i think that some mistakes are too serious to ignore or forget. for example, if a friend lied to me, betrayed me, or hurt me intentionally, i would not be able to trust or respect them anymore. i think that friendship requires honesty, loyalty, and care, and that big mistakes can damage these qualities. therefore, i believe that mistakes can not break friendship if they are small and sincere, but they can if they are big and harmful.",
      "Outcome3": "However, not everyone agrees that a mistake is easily forgivable and friendship is more important than anything. some people might argue that a mistake can break friendship if it is a big one or if it shows disrespect, dishonesty, or betrayal. they might think that friendship is based on trust and loyalty, and that a mistake can damage or destroy these values. in contrast, the right text expresses this view and gives an example of a mistake that can ruin friendship.",
      "Outcome4": "A mistake can not break friendship if it is not a big one, because friendship is forever and a gift for our life. but what kind of mistakes are big enough to ruin a friendship? i think it depends on the situation and the relationship between the friends. some mistakes may be serious, such as lying, betraying, or hurting someone intentionally. these mistakes can damage the trust and respect that are essential for a true friendship. other mistakes may be minor, such as forgetting a birthday, saying something rude, or breaking a gift. these mistakes can be forgiven and forgotten if the friends communicate honestly and sincerely. they can also learn from their mistakes and improve their friendship. friendship is a gift for our life because it gives us support, comfort, joy, and growth. it is more valuable and lasting than any material thing. that is why i agree with the left text that a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, i agree with the idea that a mistake cannot break friendship if it is not a big one. friendship is more valuable and lasting than any material thing or minor offense. of course, some mistakes are too serious or harmful to forgive easily, but most of the time, we can overcome them with understanding and communication. a good friend is someone who accepts us with our flaws and helps us to grow and improve. we should not let a small mistake ruin a long and meaningful friendship.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, i agree with the idea that a mistake cannot break friendship if it is not a big one. friendship is more valuable and lasting than any material thing or minor offense. a true friend will forgive and understand, and not hold a grudge or resentment."

      "Outcome2": "These are some of the negative effects of mobile phone games on children's social skills. playing games on the phone can distract children from interacting with their peers, parents and teachers, and reduce their opportunities to develop social and emotional skills. moreover, some games can expose children to violent and aggressive content, which can influence their attitudes and behaviours. therefore, it is important to monitor and limit the use of mobile phone games by children, and encourage them to engage in more positive and meaningful activities.",
      "Outcome3": "Mobile phone games can harm children's social skills in various ways. for example, playing violent games can reduce children's empathy and sensitivity to others' feelings and needs, as they become desensitized to the consequences of their actions. moreover, playing games can also distract children from engaging in face-to-face interactions with their peers and family, which are essential for developing social and emotional competencies. by spending too much time on games, children may miss out on opportunities to learn how to cooperate, communicate, and resolve conflicts with others. therefore, mobile phone games can impair children's ability to form healthy and meaningful relationships.",
      "Outcome4": "These are some of the negative impacts that mobile phones can have on children's social development and well-being. mobile phones can distract children from their studies, expose them to inappropriate content, and encourage them to be more violent and less empathetic. my argument is that parents and educators should be more aware of these risks and monitor and limit the use of mobile phones by children. by doing so, they can help children to balance their online and offline activities, protect them from harmful influences, and foster their communication and social skills.",
      "Outcome5": "These are some of the negative impacts that mobile phones can have on children's social development and mental health. while mobile phones can facilitate communication, they can also create barriers and conflicts among children and their families, peers and teachers. they can also expose children to harmful and addictive content that can influence their behaviour and attitudes. therefore, it is important to monitor and limit the use of mobile phones by children and to encourage them to engage in more positive and healthy activities.",
      "Outcome6": "These are some of the negative impacts that mobile phones can have on children's social development and well-being. playing violent games on their phones can desensitize them to real-life violence and make them more prone to aggression and anger. moreover, spending too much time on their phones can reduce their face-to-face interactions and social skills, leading to isolation and loneliness. therefore, parents and educators should be aware of these risks and monitor their children's phone usage and behaviour. however, mobile phones are not only a source of problems, but also a useful tool for communication, as i will explain in the next paragraph."

      "Outcome1": "Mass media refers to the various channels of communication that reach large audiences, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, and the internet. through mass media, advertisers can expose their products to millions of potential customers, who may be influenced by the messages, images, and appeals of the advertisements. by using mass media, advertisers can create awareness, interest, desire, and action for their products, as well as shape the opinions, attitudes, and values of the consumers. mass media can also create a sense of social validation, conformity, and popularity for the products, as consumers may want to fit in with the trends, norms, and expectations of their peers and society. therefore, mass media is a powerful tool for creating a well-known product that can attract and persuade consumers to buy it.",
      "Outcome2": "Although advertisements can increase the popularity of a product, they cannot guarantee its quality. a product that is widely advertised may attract the attention of consumers, but it may also disappoint them if it does not meet their expectations or needs. therefore, product quality is another important factor that influences the consumer's decision making process. a product that has high quality can satisfy the consumer's demands, enhance the consumer's loyalty, and create a positive word-of-mouth effect. on the other hand, a product that has low quality can damage the consumer's trust, reduce the consumer's satisfaction, and generate a negative feedback loop. thus, product quality is an essential component of a product's success in the market.",
      "Outcome3": "However, advertisements are not always beneficial for consumers and society. they can also have some drawbacks that may outweigh their advantages. for example, advertisements can create false or exaggerated claims about the product, misleading the consumers and creating unrealistic expectations. they can also manipulate the consumers' emotions and preferences, making them buy things they do not need or want. moreover, advertisements can increase the consumption of harmful or wasteful products, such as junk food, cigarettes, or plastic. this can have negative impacts on the health and well-being of the consumers and the environment. therefore, consumers and society should be critical and aware of the advertisements they encounter and not let them influence their decisions without rational thinking.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, advertisements play a crucial role in shaping the preferences and choices of consumers in the market. by exposing a product to a large audience through mass media, advertisements can increase its popularity and trustworthiness, regardless of its quality. this can give the product an edge over its competitors and influence the purchasing decisions of the consumers. therefore, advertisements are the most effective way to create a well-known product that can appeal to the society.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, advertisement is not only a way of informing and persuading the potential buyers, but also a way of creating a favorable image and reputation for the product in the market. by exposing the product to a large audience through mass media, the advertisers can influence the consumers' perception and preference for the product. the more familiar and popular the product becomes, the more likely it is that the consumers will choose it over its competitors, regardless of its actual quality. however, the advertisers also have to consider the affordability of the product, as the consumers will not buy something that is beyond their budget. thus, advertisement is a powerful tool that can shape the consumer behavior and the demand for the product.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, advertisement plays a crucial role in shaping the preferences and behaviors of the consumers in the market. by exposing the product to a large audience, it creates a sense of familiarity and recognition that influences the purchasing decisions. however, advertisement alone is not enough to ensure the success of the product. it also has to meet the expectations and needs of the consumers in terms of quality and price. otherwise, the consumers might be disappointed or dissatisfied with the product and switch to other alternatives."

      "Left": "\"Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime.\" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.",
      "Right": "Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "One reason that i think the death penalty is not effective in reducing crime rates is that it does not address the root causes of violence and injustice in society. the death penalty may deter some potential offenders, but it does not prevent others from committing crimes due to poverty, inequality, mental illness, or other factors. furthermore, the death penalty does not offer any opportunity for rehabilitation, reparation, or reconciliation for the offenders and the victims.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the reasons why the death penalty is not effective in reducing crime rates is that it does not deter potential offenders from committing violent acts. there is no clear evidence that the death penalty has a greater deterrent effect than other forms of punishment, such as life imprisonment. in fact, some studies have shown that the death penalty may actually increase the incidence of homicides by brutalizing the society and creating a culture of violence. furthermore, the death penalty is often applied in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner, depending on the race, class, gender, and location of the offender and the victim. this undermines the fairness and justice of the legal system and violates the principle of equality before the law. therefore, the death penalty is not a rational or humane response to crime.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the main reasons that some people support the death penalty is the deterrence theory, which claims that the fear of being executed would prevent potential criminals from committing violent crimes. however, this theory is not supported by statistical evidence or logical reasoning. for example, according to amnesty international, there is no conclusive proof that the death penalty has a greater deterrent effect than other punishments, such as life imprisonment. in fact, some studies have shown that the death penalty may have the opposite effect, by brutalizing the society and increasing the level of violence. furthermore, the deterrence theory ignores the fact that many crimes are committed impulsively, under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or by mentally ill or irrational people, who are not likely to be deterred by the threat of death. therefore, the deterrence theory is not a valid argument for the death penalty.",
      "Outcome4": "Another reason why i think the death penalty is not effective in reducing crime rates is that it violates the human dignity and rights of the offenders. the death penalty is not only a cruel and inhumane punishment, but also a violation of the most fundamental right of a human being: the right to life.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the reasons why i think the death penalty is not effective in reducing crime rates is that it does not address the root causes of violence and injustice in society. the death penalty is a harsh and irreversible punishment that does not offer any opportunity for rehabilitation, reparation, or reconciliation. it also ignores the factors that may influence a person's criminal behavior, such as poverty, mental illness, abuse, or discrimination. instead of deterring crime, the death penalty may actually provoke more violence and resentment, as it creates a cycle of revenge and retaliation. therefore, i believe that the death penalty is not a solution, but a problem, for the society.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the reasons why i think there is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty is that it does not deter potential offenders. according to many studies, there is no clear and consistent correlation between the use of capital punishment and the level of violent crime in a country. in fact, some countries that have abolished the death penalty have lower crime rates than those that still practice it. furthermore, the death penalty may have the opposite effect of provoking more violence and revenge, especially in cases of wrongful convictions, miscarriages of justice, or discrimination. therefore, the death penalty is not an effective or fair way to prevent or punish crime."

      "Outcome2": "One of the benefits of food that comes with instructions is that it can be healthy and tasty, without requiring much skill or time from the cook. there are many options of pre-packaged or frozen meals that are made with fresh and nutritious ingredients, such as vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, and spices. these meals can provide a balanced and satisfying diet, as well as a variety of flavors and cuisines. for example, a guy who wants to prepare a dinner for his girlfriend could choose a mediterranean chicken dish with roasted tomatoes, olives, and feta cheese, or a thai curry with coconut milk, vegetables, and rice. these meals can be easily heated in the oven or the microwave, and served with a simple salad or bread. by following the instructions, the cook can ensure that the food is cooked properly and safely, and that it retains its taste and texture. therefore, food that comes with instructions can be a convenient and enjoyable way to prepare a good food alone for some reason.",
      "Outcome3": "Preparing a good food alone for some reason can be a way of showing care and affection to someone special. for instance, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time. by doing this, he can surprise her with a delicious and healthy meal, without having to spend hours in the kitchen or be a very good cook. he can also choose the food that she likes or that suits her dietary preferences, and create a romantic atmosphere with candles, music, or flowers. this can demonstrate that he pays attention to her needs and wants, and that he is willing to make an effort to please her. therefore, preparing a dinner to his girlfriend can be a simple but meaningful gesture of love and appreciation.",

      "Outcome5": "One of the reasons why cooking skills are not as important as they used to be is the availability and variety of ready-made or semi-prepared foods that can be easily cooked at home. these foods can save time and effort for busy or inexperienced cooks, and still offer a satisfying and nutritious meal. moreover, these foods can also help people to impress their guests or partners with minimal hassle. for instance, a guy who wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend could just buy some food that comes with instructions. normally, he would just need to put it into the oven and wait some time. therefore, cooking skills are not as essential as they were in the past, when people had to rely more on their own knowledge and creativity to make good food.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the reasons why cooking skills are not as essential as they used to be is the availability of convenient and varied options for buying food. nowadays, people can easily find different kinds of food in supermarkets, restaurants, or online platforms, that cater to their preferences, budgets, and dietary needs. whether they want to have a quick snack, a balanced meal, or a special treat, they can choose from a wide range of products and services that offer convenience and quality."

      "Outcome1": "Violence in tv shows is a controversial issue that has been widely debated in recent years. some people argue that exposing audiences to violent scenes can have negative effects on their behavior and increase the risk of criminal activities. others claim that violence in tv shows is merely a form of entertainment and has no significant influence on reality. in this essay, i will examine both sides of the argument and propose some possible solutions to reduce the harm of violence in tv shows on society.",
      "Outcome2": "Reducing the proportion of violent content in tv shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. this claim is supported by various studies that have found a correlation between exposure to media violence and aggressive behavior, attitudes, and emotions. for instance, a meta-analysis of 217 studies involving over 300,000 participants concluded that media violence exposure was associated with increased aggression, reduced empathy, and desensitization to real-life violence (anderson et al., 2010). moreover, a longitudinal study of 707 adolescents in the netherlands found that exposure to violent tv and video games predicted increased delinquency and violent behavior over a four-year period, even after controlling for other risk factors (hopf et al., 2008). however, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs.",

      "Outcome4": "The negative impact of violent tv shows on children is not only a matter of reducing the crime rate, but also a matter of shaping their personality and morality. children are more vulnerable to the influence of violent tv shows because they are still developing their cognitive, emotional, and social skills. they may imitate what they see on the screen without understanding the consequences or the moral implications of their actions. they may also become desensitized to violence and lose empathy for others who suffer. moreover, violent tv shows may distort their perception of reality and make them more fearful, insecure, and distrustful of the world. therefore, exposing children to violent tv shows could harm their psychological well-being and their moral development.",
      "Outcome5": "Reducing the proportion of violent content in tv shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate, but this measure alone is not sufficient to address the root cause of the problem. the influence of violent media on young minds is particularly harmful and needs to be curbed by stricter regulations. as a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. little wonder, then, that by watching these violent tv programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal tv shows and movies. such a law would protect the mental health and moral development of the younger generation and contribute to a safer and more peaceful society.",
      "Outcome6": "Reducing the proportion of violent content in tv shows could have some positive effects on society, but it is not enough to address the root causes of crime. many studies have shown that the exposure to violence in the media can have a significant impact on the development and behavior of children and adolescents, who are more vulnerable and impressionable than adults. admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in tv shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. however, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs."

      "Outcome1": "One of the controversial policies that some cities have adopted or proposed to deal with traffic congestion is congestion pricing, which means charging drivers a fee for entering or using certain areas or roads during peak hours. the proponents of this policy claim that it can reduce traffic, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as generate revenue for public transportation and infrastructure. however, this policy has also faced strong opposition from many drivers, who argue that it is unfair, ineffective, and burdensome. rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. in these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful.",
      "Outcome2": "Congestion pricing, therefore, is not a fair or effective solution for reducing traffic congestion and pollution. it ignores the underlying causes of the problem and shifts the burden to drivers who may have no other choice but to use their cars. for example, some drivers may need to commute long distances to work or school, or to access essential services that are not available in their neighborhoods. others may have disabilities or special needs that make public transportation inaccessible or impractical. charging them extra fees would only increase their financial hardship and stress, without addressing the root causes of their travel needs. moreover, congestion pricing may have unintended consequences, such as encouraging drivers to avoid the tolls by using alternative routes that may be more congested, unsafe, or harmful to the environment. congestion pricing may also create inequities between different groups of drivers, such as low-income, rural, or minority drivers, who may be disproportionately affected by the fees.",
      "Outcome3": "Some might argue that congestion pricing is a fair and effective way to reduce traffic congestion and pollution, as it makes drivers pay for the costs they impose on others and the environment. they might also claim that congestion pricing can generate revenue for public transport and infrastructure improvements, or that it can encourage drivers to switch to alternative modes of transport or travel at less busy times. however, these arguments are not convincing or sufficient for several reasons.",
      "Outcome4": "While imposing congestion fees on drivers might seem like an easy way to reduce traffic and pollution, there are other ways that the government could tackle this issue more effectively and fairly. for example, the government could invest in public transportation systems that are reliable, affordable, and accessible, and that could reduce the reliance on private cars. alternatively, the government could promote the adoption of electric vehicles, hybrid cars, or other low-emission technologies, and provide incentives or subsidies for drivers who switch to them. furthermore, the government could implement smart traffic management systems that optimize the flow of traffic and reduce delays and accidents. these solutions could not only improve the mobility and quality of life of the citizens, but also protect the environment and enhance the sustainability of the city.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, imposing congestion fees on drivers is not a fair or effective solution to reduce traffic problems and pollution. it would only burden the drivers who have no choice but to use their cars for work or other purposes, while ignoring the root causes of the traffic congestion and the environmental impact. the government should not simply shift the responsibility to the drivers, but rather take more proactive measures to improve the transportation system and the energy efficiency.",
      "Outcome6": "To sum up, the argument that congestion fees can reduce traffic and pollution is not convincing, as it ignores the underlying causes of these issues and unfairly punishes drivers who may have no other choice. a more effective and fair approach would be to address the structural and systemic factors that contribute to inefficient and harmful transportation patterns. for example, (right text)"

      "Outcome3": "Traditional school can also help students develop better academic skills and habits than home school. by attending classes regularly, students can follow a structured curriculum that covers the essential topics and skills for their grade level. they can also receive feedback and guidance from teachers who are trained and experienced in their subjects. moreover, students can benefit from the resources and facilities that schools provide, such as libraries, labs, and extracurricular activities. these can enrich their learning and stimulate their curiosity and creativity. home school, on the other hand, may not offer the same level of quality and diversity in education, and may depend on the parents' or tutors' ability and availability to teach and support the students.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, traditional school has many benefits that online learning cannot offer, such as socialization, cooperation, and interaction. while online learning may provide convenience and flexibility, it also isolates students from their peers and teachers, and limits their exposure to diverse perspectives and experiences. traditional school helps students develop essential skills and qualities that will prepare them for their future careers and lives. therefore, i believe that traditional school is better than online learning for most students.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, traditional school has some benefits that online learning cannot provide, especially in terms of socialization. by attending school, students can interact with their classmates, make friends, and develop their communication and interpersonal skills. these skills are essential for their personal and professional growth, as well as for their mental and emotional well-being. online learning, on the other hand, may isolate students from their peers and limit their exposure to diverse perspectives and experiences.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, traditional school not only provides academic knowledge, but also fosters social skills that are essential for personal and professional development. by interacting with classmates, teachers, and other members of the school community, students can learn how to communicate effectively, respect diversity, resolve conflicts, and build trust. these skills can help them adapt to different situations and challenges in the future."

      "Outcome2": "One of the most pressing environmental issues facing the world today is the lack of access to clean and safe water for millions of people, especially in developing countries such as africa. water scarcity can lead to disease, poverty, conflict, and migration. however, a new technology could offer a solution by turning sea water into drinking water. the technology works by using high-pressure pumps to create vapour jets from sea water, which are then passed through tiny tubes made of carbon nanomaterials. the tubes act as filters, allowing only water molecules to pass through and leaving behind salt and other impurities. the result is fresh water that can be used for drinking, irrigation, sanitation, and other purposes. this technology could provide a sustainable and low-cost way of addressing the water crisis, as sea water is abundant and renewable, and the carbon nanotubes are durable and efficient. by harnessing this technology, developing countries could improve their living standards, health, and economic development.",
      "Outcome3": "These are just some of the innovative ways that technology is addressing the water problems that plague many parts of the world. however, water is not the only scarce and vital resource that humanity needs to sustain itself. energy is another crucial factor that affects the quality of life, the development of economies, and the protection of the environment. yet, the conventional sources of energy, such as fossil fuels, coal, and nuclear, have many drawbacks. they are finite, expensive, polluting, and risky. they contribute to climate change, air pollution, and health problems. they also depend on geopolitical factors and create conflicts and inequalities. therefore, there is a pressing need for alternative solutions that can provide clean, abundant, and affordable energy for all. one of the most promising candidates is space solar power, which is the focus of an ambitious project by japan.",
      "Outcome4": "These are just some of the examples of how technology is advancing to help the environment and solve global challenges. another ambitious project that could revolutionize the world's energy supply is the space solar power system that japan is working on. the idea is to launch giant satellites into orbit that can collect the sun's rays and beam them down to earth as microwaves or lasers. unlike terrestrial solar panels, the satellites would not be affected by weather, seasons, or nightfall. they could provide a constant and clean source of electricity for any region of the world. according to some estimates, a single satellite could generate enough power for 1 million homes, and a global network of satellites could meet the entire world's demand. this would reduce the reliance on fossil fuels, nuclear plants, and other polluting or risky sources of energy. it would also create new opportunities for economic development, innovation, and cooperation.",
      "Outcome5": "These are just some of the examples of how technology is helping the environment and improving the quality of life for millions of people. however, there are also many challenges and risks involved in pursuing such ambitious projects. for instance, how can we ensure that the water purification technology is accessible and affordable for the communities that need it most? how can we avoid potential conflicts or sabotage over the space solar power system, which would require international cooperation and regulation? how can we balance the benefits of innovation with the ethical and social implications of transforming the natural world? technology can be a powerful tool for environmental protection and human development, but it also requires careful and responsible use.",
      "Outcome6": "These are just some of the examples of how technology is transforming the environment for the better. however, not all technological innovations are equally beneficial or accessible to everyone. there are still many challenges and barriers that need to be overcome to ensure that the benefits of technology are shared fairly and sustainably. for instance, how can we ensure that the water purification technology is affordable and reliable for the communities that need it most? how can we prevent the space solar power system from becoming a source of conflict or domination by a few powerful countries? how can we balance the ethical and social implications of such radical changes to our energy and water systems? these are the questions that we need to address as we embrace the potential of technology to improve the environment."

      "Left": "First of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.",
      "Right": "Admittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching."

      "Prompt3": "Rebut the counterargument by showing the limitations or drawbacks of relying on TV and movies for socialization, and suggest some alternative ways for children to interact with others.",

    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Although some people may argue that watching tv and movies can have some positive effects on children's social skills and cultural awareness, i believe that they can also have detrimental effects on their academic performance. tv and movies can distract children from their homework, reduce their attention span, and expose them to inappropriate or misleading information. therefore, i think that parents should limit and monitor their children's tv and movie consumption and encourage them to focus more on their studies.",
      "Outcome2": "However, watching tv and movies excessively and indiscriminately can also have negative impacts on children's social development. for instance, children may become less interested in other activities that can enhance their creativity, communication, and cooperation skills, such as reading, playing, or joining clubs. moreover, children may be exposed to inappropriate or harmful contents that can influence their values, attitudes, and behaviors, such as violence, stereotypes, or consumerism. therefore, parents and teachers should monitor and guide children's tv and movie consumption and help them balance it with other forms of learning and entertainment.",
      "Outcome3": "However, watching tv and movies for the sake of socialization has its own limitations and drawbacks. first of all, tv and movies are not always reliable sources of information and values, and they may expose children to inappropriate or harmful messages that could influence their attitudes and behaviors. for example, some tv shows and movies may glamorize violence, drugs, or sex, or stereotype certain groups of people, which could lead to children developing prejudices or misconceptions. second, watching tv and movies excessively could reduce children's opportunities and abilities to engage in other forms of social interaction, such as face-to-face communication, physical activities, or hobbies. these forms of interaction are essential for children to develop their social skills, emotional intelligence, and self-confidence, as well as to learn from others and express themselves. therefore, children should not rely on tv and movies as their main or only source of socialization, but rather balance their screen time with other more meaningful and diverse ways of interacting with their peers. for instance, they could join clubs, teams, or groups that share their interests or passions, or they could participate in community service, cultural events, or outdoor adventures that could enrich their experiences and perspectives.",
      "Outcome4": "To sum up, i believe that children should watch tv and movies in moderation and under parental guidance, because too much exposure to these media can have negative effects on their academic performance, self-control, and moral values. my own experience as a child who wasted a lot of time watching tv instead of doing homework supports this argument. although watching tv and movies can also have some benefits for children's social skills and cultural knowledge, these advantages can be outweighed by the drawbacks if children are not selective and critical about what they are watching. therefore, my thesis statement is that children should watch tv and movies with limits and supervision. by doing so, they can enjoy the entertainment and education that these media offer, without compromising their development and well-being. this is a crucial issue that parents and educators should pay attention to, as tv and movies can have a lasting impact on children's lives.",
      "Outcome5": "However, wasting time on tv is not the only problem that children may face when they watch tv and movies excessively. there are also some negative effects on their physical and mental health, as well as their moral development. for example, watching too much tv can cause eye strain, obesity, sleep deprivation, and attention deficit disorder. moreover, some tv programs and movies may expose children to inappropriate or harmful messages, such as violence, sex, drugs, racism, or consumerism. these messages can influence children's attitudes, values, and behaviors, and make them more aggressive, materialistic, or disrespectful. therefore, parents should monitor and limit their children's tv and movie viewing, and guide them to choose quality and educational programs.",
      "Outcome6": "However, the negative effects of watching tv and movies for a long time are not limited to academic performance. there are also other aspects of children's development that could be harmed by excessive exposure to media. for example, watching tv and movies could influence children's values, attitudes, and behaviors in undesirable ways. depending on the quality and appropriateness of the programs, children could learn inaccurate or biased information, imitate violent or inappropriate actions, or develop unrealistic or unhealthy expectations. moreover, watching tv and movies could reduce children's physical activity, creativity, and social skills, as they spend less time playing, reading, or interacting with others. therefore, it is important for parents to monitor and limit the amount and content of tv and movies that their children watch."

      "Outcome3": "However, animal conservation is not only a matter of sentimental or aesthetic value, but also a vital aspect of maintaining the health and diversity of our planet. animals play important roles in the ecological balance of different habitats, such as pollinating plants, dispersing seeds, controlling pests, and recycling nutrients. losing any species can have unpredictable and harmful consequences for the environment and the human well-being. moreover, animals are a valuable source of scientific knowledge and innovation, as they can provide insights into evolution, genetics, physiology, medicine, and behavior. many animals have unique adaptations and abilities that can inspire new technologies and solutions for human challenges. furthermore, animals are an integral part of the cultural diversity and heritage of many peoples, as they are symbols of identity, spirituality, and history. preserving animals can help us respect and appreciate the richness and diversity of life on earth.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, this essay has argued that saving endangered animals is not as important as solving human problems, because animals have always been subject to natural selection and extinction, while humans have the responsibility and the ability to improve their own conditions. however, this does not mean that we should ignore the value and the role of animals in the ecosystem and in our culture. there are some ways that we can balance our needs and interests with those of other species, such as promoting environmental education, reducing overconsumption and pollution, supporting sustainable development and conservation projects, and respecting animal rights and welfare. by doing so, we can not only enhance our own survival and quality of life, but also preserve the diversity and beauty of nature for the future generations.",
      "Outcome5": "However, some people might argue that preserving endangered animals is not only a moral duty, but also a way of maintaining the balance and diversity of nature. they might claim that every species has a unique role and value in the ecosystem, and that losing any of them could have unforeseen and detrimental consequences for the environment and human welfare. moreover, they might point out that many animals are endangered because of human activities, such as habitat destruction, poaching, pollution and climate change, and that we have a responsibility to mitigate the harm we have caused and to protect the natural heritage for future generations.",

      "Outcome2": "The relationship between environmental protection and economic development is a complex and controversial one. some people argue that economic development is essential for improving the living standards and well-being of human beings, and that environmental protection is a luxury that can be afforded only after achieving a certain level of wealth and stability. however, others contend that this view is shortsighted and irresponsible, and that environmental protection is far more urgent than economic development. they claim that all the living creatures live together on our mother earth and she is the only one. without earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. therefore, they advocate for a more balanced and sustainable approach that integrates environmental and economic goals and respects the natural limits and resources of our planet.",
      "Outcome3": "First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic development because the latter depends on the former. economic development cannot be sustained if the natural resources are depleted, the ecosystems are damaged, and the climate is destabilized. these environmental problems threaten not only the quality of life, but also the security and stability of the human society. moreover, environmental degradation often affects the most vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as the poor, the indigenous, and the women, who depend on the natural environment for their livelihoods and well-being. therefore, prioritizing environmental protection over economic development is not only a moral duty, but also a rational choice. all the living creatures live together on our mother earth and she is the only one. without earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well.",
      "Outcome4": "However, some people may argue that economic developments are more important than environmental protection. they may claim that economic growth can provide more resources, jobs, and opportunities for human well-being and progress. they may also point out that environmental protection can impose costs, regulations, and limitations on economic activities and innovation. they may believe that economic developments can solve or mitigate the environmental problems in the long run.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people may argue that economic developments are more important than environmental protection, because they can improve human living standards and create more opportunities for growth and innovation. however, this argument ignores the fact that economic activities often have negative impacts on the environment, such as pollution, deforestation, climate change, and biodiversity loss. these impacts not only threaten the survival and well-being of other living creatures, but also undermine the long-term sustainability and resilience of our mother earth. the left text points out that environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments, because earth is the only home we have and we cannot afford to lose her. the right text further illustrates this point by using an analogy of a man and his body. just as a man needs a healthy body to live and function, all the living creatures as a whole need a strong planet to thrive and coexist. therefore, we should not sacrifice environmental protection for short-term economic gains, but rather seek a balance between them that respects and preserves the natural resources and ecosystems that support life on earth.",
      "Outcome6": "Some people may argue that economic developments are more important than environmental protection, because they can improve people's living standards, create more jobs, and generate more wealth. however, this argument ignores the fact that economic activities often have negative impacts on the environment, such as pollution, deforestation, climate change, and biodiversity loss. these impacts not only threaten the health and well-being of humans, but also of other living creatures that share the planet with us. therefore, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. all the living creatures live together on our mother earth and she is the only one. without earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well."

      "Outcome1": "One of the most debated issues in public health is whether smoking should be banned in public places or not. some people argue that smokers have the right to choose their lifestyle and enjoy their habit, while others contend that smoking infringes on the rights of non-smokers and exposes them to serious health risks. in this essay, i will argue that a total ban on public smoking is necessary and beneficial for the society, based on the following reasons. firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. recent death statistic released by the malaysian ministry of health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. a large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.",
      "Outcome2": "Banning public smoking is not only a measure to protect the health of the smokers themselves, but also a way to safeguard the well-being of the public and the environment. by prohibiting smoking in public places, such as parks, restaurants, and offices, the exposure of non-smokers to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke can be minimized. this can prevent or reduce the risk of developing respiratory infections, asthma, allergies, and cancer among the passive smokers. moreover, banning public smoking can also reduce the environmental pollution caused by the discarded cigarette butts, ashes, and smoke. these can contaminate the soil, water, and air, and pose a threat to the wildlife and the ecosystem. therefore, banning public smoking can have positive impacts on the public health and the environment.",
      "Outcome3": "Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. recent death statistic released by the malaysian ministry of health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. a large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented. secondly, banning public smoking can also benefit the society in terms of improving the air quality and reducing the health care costs. according to the world health organization, tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic and carcinogenic, and can cause various respiratory and cardiovascular problems (who, 2020). moreover, smoking imposes a huge economic burden on the health system, as it increases the risk of hospitalization, medication, and disability (mackay et al., 2006). by prohibiting smoking in public places, the government can protect the public health and the environment, as well as save money and resources.",
      "Outcome4": "However, some might argue that banning public smoking is an infringement of personal freedom and choice, or that it would harm the economy and the livelihood of tobacco farmers and sellers. these claims are not convincing because the right to smoke does not justify the harm and risk it imposes on others who have no choice but to breathe the polluted air. moreover, the economic and social costs of smoking-related illnesses and deaths are far greater than the benefits of the tobacco industry, which could be replaced by more sustainable and healthy alternatives.",
      "Outcome5": "Smoking not only harms the smoker, but also endangers the health of those who are exposed to the smoke involuntarily. this is especially true for young children and pregnant women, who are more susceptible to lung related diseases that can be fatal. therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented. however, some people may argue that banning smoking in public places is a violation of their personal freedom and choice, and that they have the right to enjoy their habit as long as they do not harm others directly. they may also claim that smoking has some benefits, such as relieving stress, enhancing concentration, or socializing with others.",
      "Outcome6": "However, the health risks of smoking are not the only reason why public smoking should be prohibited. another argument in favor of a total ban is the environmental impact of cigarette waste and pollution. right text"

      "Outcome1": "These are some of the reasons why i strongly support allocating more funds to education and prevention programs in the health sector. by investing in these areas, we can not only reduce the burden on the health system, but also improve the quality of life and well-being of the population. education and prevention can help people avoid or manage many chronic and communicable diseases, as well as promote healthy behaviors and lifestyles. therefore, i think that education and prevention should receive a greater budget than treatment.",
      "Outcome2": "One way to demonstrate the benefits of education and prevention for health is to look at some successful examples from different countries. for instance, in finland, a comprehensive program of health education and prevention reduced the mortality rate from cardiovascular diseases by 80% in 30 years, saving thousands of lives and millions of euros in health care costs. similarly, in australia, a national campaign of skin cancer prevention and early detection reduced the incidence and mortality of melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer, by 50% in 20 years. these examples show that investing in education and prevention can have a significant impact on reducing the burden of disease and improving the quality of life of the population. in conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.",
      "Outcome3": "To sum up, this essay has argued that education and prevention issues deserve more funding than treatment in the health sector. it has shown how investing in education and prevention can reduce the prevalence and severity of diseases, lower the costs and burdens on the health system, and enhance the quality of life and productivity of the population. these benefits outweigh the possible drawbacks of diverting resources from treatment, such as the ethical dilemmas, the uncertainty of outcomes, and the resistance from some stakeholders. therefore, the essay supports the view that education and prevention are more important and effective than treatment in addressing the health challenges of the society.",
      "Outcome4": "The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. i believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients. moreover, education and prevention can also enhance the quality of life and well-being of individuals and communities by reducing the risks of chronic diseases, disabilities, and premature deaths. in conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being. investing in education and prevention is not only a moral duty, but also a smart and sustainable strategy for the future of our society.",
      "Outcome5": "One way to illustrate the benefits of education and prevention issues for the health system is to consider the economic impact of reducing the burden of diseases. according to the world health organization, investing in health promotion and disease prevention can generate significant returns for individuals, communities, and countries. for example, a study estimated that every us dollar spent on immunization programs in low- and middle-income countries could save 16 dollars in healthcare costs, lost wages, and lost productivity. moreover, preventing chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer can also lower the demand for expensive and complex treatments, and improve the quality of life and productivity of the population. thus, allocating more resources to education and prevention issues can not only enhance the health system, but also contribute to social and economic development.",
      "Outcome6": "Educating people about health risks and how to avoid them can help them to adopt healthier lifestyles, such as exercising, eating well, and avoiding smoking and alcohol. these habits can reduce the chances of developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, which can impair the quality of life and increase the burden on the health system."

      "Outcome2": "Banning smoking in public places is not only beneficial for the health of the smoker, but also for the health of the non-smoker. by reducing the exposure to secondhand smoke, the risk of developing respiratory infections, asthma, heart diseases, and cancers is lowered. moreover, banning smoking in public places can also encourage smokers to quit or reduce their consumption, which can improve their overall health and well-being. furthermore, banning smoking in public places can also protect the environment from the harmful effects of cigarette litter and air pollution. therefore, banning smoking in public places is a positive and effective measure to promote public health and safety.",
      "Outcome3": "Besides the health benefits, banning public smoking also has positive impacts on the environment and the economy. according to the world health organization, smoking is a major contributor to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, which affect the climate and the quality of life. moreover, smoking imposes huge costs on the society, such as medical expenses, productivity losses, and fire damages. a study by the university of malaya estimated that the total economic cost of smoking in malaysia was about 4.8 billion ringgit in 2004, equivalent to 1.2% of the gross domestic product. by enforcing a total ban on public smoking, the government can save resources, promote green development, and enhance public welfare. (who, 2014; aljunid et al., 2009)",
      "Outcome4": "Hence, a total ban on public smoking is not only justified but also necessary to protect the lives and well-being of both smokers and non-smokers. by enforcing this policy, the authorities can prevent the spread of harmful substances and diseases, as well as promote a cleaner and safer environment for everyone. moreover, a total ban on public smoking can also encourage smokers to quit or reduce their habit, which can benefit their health and save them money in the long run. therefore, i strongly urge all citizens to support and comply with this measure, and to persuade others to do the same. together, we can make a positive difference for ourselves and our future generations.",
      "Outcome5": "In addition to the health benefits of banning public smoking, there are also other positive impacts that can be derived from this policy. for instance, it can help to reduce the environmental pollution caused by cigarette butts and ashes, which are often discarded carelessly on the streets and parks. furthermore, it can also improve the quality of life and comfort of non-smokers, who can enjoy public spaces without being exposed to the unpleasant smell and harmful effects of tobacco smoke. by respecting the rights of others to breathe clean air, smokers can also demonstrate their social responsibility and civic awareness.",
      "Outcome6": "Besides the health benefits, a total ban on public smoking also has other positive impacts on the society and the environment. for instance, it can reduce the littering of cigarette butts and ashes, which are not only unsightly but also harmful to the wildlife and the water sources. moreover, it can improve the air quality and the comfort level of non-smokers, especially in enclosed or crowded spaces such as restaurants, buses, or cinemas. furthermore, it can encourage smokers to quit or reduce their habit, which can save them money and improve their well-being. thus, a total ban on public smoking can be seen as a win-win situation for everyone."

It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people."

      "Outcome1": "Traffic overload is a common problem that plagues many big cities nowadays, as they can be described as melting pots of diverse cultures and lifestyles. the congestion and pollution caused by overpopulation have aroused the interest of many city planners, who seek to find effective ways to cope with this challenge. some of them argue that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. however, i have to profoundly disagree with this idea, for there are still two viable solutions besides this way. in this essay, i will discuss how the development of public transportation and the relocation of urban areas can help to alleviate the traffic overload in big cities.",
      "Outcome2": "One possible solution to deal with traffic overload is to improve the public transportation system and encourage people to use it more often. by providing more frequent, reliable, and affordable buses, trains, or subways, city planners can reduce the reliance on private cars and motorcycles, which often clog the roads and cause pollution. moreover, by promoting the benefits of public transport, such as saving time, money, and energy, as well as reducing carbon footprint and stress, city planners can persuade more people to choose this mode of travel over driving. this way, the demand to go out on the street can be moderated without sacrificing the mobility and convenience of the urban dwellers.",
      "Outcome3": "Another feasible solution to the problem of traffic overload in big cities is to make use of the urban areas that surround the city centers. by relocating some of the major attractions and institutions that draw people from far and wide to the outskirts of the city, we can reduce the need for long-distance commuting and create more balanced and diversified urban development. for example, if some of the large shopping malls or universities were moved to the suburban areas, they would not only serve the local residents but also attract new businesses and services that would create more employment opportunities and improve the quality of life. this would also ease the burden on the city facilities, such as public transport, roads, parking, water, and electricity, that are often strained by the high demand and limited supply. by creating more livable and accessible urban areas, we can also enhance the social and cultural diversity of the city and foster a sense of community and belonging among the residents.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, i have refuted the claim that reducing the demand to go out on the street is the only way to tackle the problem of traffic overload in big cities. instead, i have proposed two alternative solutions that can address the root causes of this issue: improving the public transportation system and decentralizing the urban areas. by implementing these solutions, not only can we ease the traffic congestion and enhance the mobility of the citizens, but also we can improve the quality of life and the environment in the city and the surrounding regions. therefore, i urge the city planners and the authorities to consider these options and take action to make our cities more livable and sustainable.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the viable solutions that i would like to propose is to improve the public transportation system. this means not only expanding the network of buses, subways, and trains, but also making them more affordable, convenient, and environmentally friendly. by doing so, we can encourage more people to use public transport instead of driving their own cars, which would reduce the emissions, congestion, and accidents on the road. moreover, public transport can also facilitate the mobility and accessibility of people who live or work in different parts of the city, thus enhancing the social and economic opportunities for them. another benefit of public transport is that it can foster a sense of community and diversity among the passengers, who come from different backgrounds and cultures. this leads me to the second solution, which is to make use of the urban areas.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the viable solutions that i would like to propose is to improve the public transportation system. it is undeniable that many people choose to drive their own cars or motorcycles because of the lack of convenience, safety, and affordability of the buses, trains, or subways. if the government could invest more in expanding and upgrading the public transportation network, providing more incentives and subsidies for the users, and enforcing stricter regulations and penalties for the private vehicle owners, it would encourage more people to switch to the more eco-friendly and efficient mode of transport. this would not only reduce the traffic congestion, but also the air pollution and noise level in the city."

      "Outcome3": "One of the main advantages of standardized tests is that they help teachers to fairly grade the students according to their actual knowledge and skills. standardized tests are designed to measure the students' mastery of the curriculum objectives and to compare their performance with a large sample of peers. this way, teachers can avoid bias and subjectivity in their assessment and ensure that the grades reflect the students' true academic achievement. for example, some students may not participate much in class discussions or activities, but they may have a deep understanding of the subject matter and perform well on the tests. conversely, some students may seem engaged and enthusiastic in class, but they may lack the necessary content knowledge or problem-solving skills to succeed on the tests. therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. in addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.",
      "Outcome4": "To sum up, standardized tests are a beneficial tool for assessing students' knowledge and skills in a fair and consistent manner. they allow teachers to evaluate the students who may not participate much in class, but have a good grasp of the material. they also simplify the grading process for teachers who base their marks on the exam scores. therefore, standardized tests are preferable to other forms of evaluation.",
      "Outcome5": "Standardized tests are not only beneficial for teachers, but also for students who want to pursue higher education or apply for scholarships. right text is: this is because standardized tests provide an objective and comparable measure of the students' academic performance and potential. for instance, many colleges and universities require students to take standardized tests such as the sat or the act as part of their admission process. similarly, many scholarship programs use standardized test scores as one of the criteria to select the best candidates. therefore, standardized tests can help students to demonstrate their skills and knowledge and to access more opportunities for their future.",
      "Outcome6": "However, standardized tests are not without drawbacks, and some critics argue that they are not an accurate or fair measure of student achievement. for instance, standardized tests may not account for the different learning styles, backgrounds, and interests of the students, and may impose a rigid and narrow curriculum that stifles creativity and critical thinking. moreover, standardized tests may create undue pressure and anxiety for the students, and may lead to cheating, teaching to the test, and reduced motivation. therefore, exams should not be the only way for teachers to evaluate the students' progress and potential."

      "Outcome1": "Some people may argue that police officers should be allowed to carry guns in order to defend themselves and the public from dangerous criminals. however, this essay will contend that arming the police with lethal weapons would have more negative than positive consequences for the society. first of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. as a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one. in the following paragraphs, i will present some further arguments and evidence to support my claim that police should not be armed with guns.",
      "Outcome2": "Police carrying guns is a controversial issue in some countries, as it raises questions about the balance between security and human rights, the effectiveness and accountability of law enforcement, and the impact of firearms on public safety and social order. some people argue that police carrying guns is necessary to deter and respond to violent crime, especially when criminals are armed with sophisticated weapons. they claim that police carrying guns can protect themselves and civilians from harm, and uphold the rule of law and justice. however, others contend that police carrying guns is excessive and dangerous, as it increases the risk of accidental or intentional shootings, abuse of power, and escalation of violence. they assert that police carrying guns can harm innocent people and damage property, and undermine the trust and cooperation between the police and the community. therefore, police carrying guns is a complex and contentious issue that requires careful evaluation and regulation.",
      "Outcome3": "There are many cases where police armed with guns have caused harm to civilians and facilities, either intentionally or unintentionally. for example, in the united states, where police routinely carry firearms, there have been numerous incidents of police shooting unarmed or innocent people, such as breonna taylor, george floyd, and jacob blake, sparking widespread protests and outrage. in addition, police armed with guns can also trigger violent responses from criminals or suspects, leading to shootouts and standoffs that endanger bystanders and damage property. for instance, in 2019, a police chase and shootout in florida resulted in the deaths of four people, including two innocent hostages, and the injury of several others, as well as the destruction of vehicles and buildings. therefore, police armed with guns can create a vicious cycle of violence and fear in society.",
      "Outcome4": "However, some might argue that having a police force that carries guns is necessary and beneficial for maintaining law and order, deterring crime, and ensuring public safety. they could point out that police officers who are armed with guns can respond more effectively and decisively to dangerous situations, such as terrorist attacks, hostage situations, or armed robberies. they could also claim that police officers who are armed with guns can protect themselves and their colleagues from being overpowered or killed by armed criminals, and that they can use their guns as a last resort when other means of force or persuasion fail. furthermore, they could suggest that police officers who are armed with guns can project authority and confidence, and that they can gain respect and trust from the public and the criminals alike.",
      "Outcome5": "However, some people may argue that police carrying guns is a necessary measure to deter crime and ensure public safety. they may point out that police officers face many dangerous situations and need to be able to defend themselves and others from armed criminals. they may also claim that police guns can prevent more serious violence by intimidating potential offenders or stopping them before they harm more people. according to this view, a society that its police force carries guns is not necessarily a highly violent one, but rather a realistic and pragmatic one.",
      "Outcome6": "However, some people may argue that police armed with guns can deter crime and maintain order more effectively than those without them. they may point out that criminals would be less likely to commit violent acts if they knew that the police could respond with lethal force. they may also claim that police with guns can protect themselves and their colleagues from dangerous situations and prevent criminals from escaping or harming others. furthermore, they may suggest that police with guns can uphold the law and the rights of the citizens more confidently and assertively than those who rely on other means of persuasion or coercion."

      "Outcome1": "Writing e-mail is not only a time-saving and honest way of communication, but also a fluent and persuasive one. however, other methods of communication may have some advantages and disadvantages that should be considered. for example, phone calls can convey the tone and emotion of the speaker, but they may also be interrupted by noise or poor signal. letters can show the personality and care of the writer, but they may take a long time to arrive or get lost in the mail. face-to-face conversations can allow for immediate feedback and nonverbal cues, but they may also cause embarrassment or conflict if the topic is sensitive or controversial. therefore, depending on the purpose and context of the communication, e-mail may be the best choice for some people.",
      "Outcome2": "Writing e-mail helps people express honestly not only when they have to deal with sensitive issues, but also when they want to share their opinions or feelings more freely. for example, when i was in college, i had a group project with some classmates who were not very cooperative or responsible. i felt frustrated and angry, but i did not want to confront them directly in class or in front of the professor. so i decided to write them an e-mail, explaining why i was dissatisfied with their performance and what i expected from them. i was able to express myself clearly and politely, without being interrupted or influenced by their reactions. i also gave them a chance to respond and improve their work. writing e-mail helped me communicate honestly and effectively with my group members.",
      "Outcome3": "Writing e-mail not only helps people express honestly, but also enhances their fluency and persuasiveness in communication. by composing e-mail, people can organize their thoughts, choose the right words, and avoid interruptions or distractions. they can also revise and edit their messages before sending them, making sure they convey their ideas clearly and effectively. for example, if i want to persuade my boss to approve my project proposal, i can write a detailed and convincing e-mail that highlights the benefits and feasibility of my plan, instead of relying on a brief and nervous oral presentation.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, writing e-mail has many advantages for people who want to communicate effectively and honestly. e-mail allows us to express our thoughts clearly and avoid the awkwardness and pressure of face-to-face conversations. it also helps us to save time and resources by avoiding unnecessary travel and phone calls. therefore, i recommend that people use e-mail as a primary mode of communication for personal and professional purposes. however, e-mail communication is not perfect and may have some drawbacks, such as misinterpretation, lack of emotion, and security issues. thus, further research is needed to explore how to improve the quality and safety of e-mail communication and how to balance it with other forms of communication.",
      "Outcome5": "Writing e-mail also allows people to communicate with others who are far away or have different schedules. for example, if i want to share some news with my friend who lives in another country, i can just send him an e-mail and he can read it whenever he has time. i don't have to worry about the time difference or the phone bill. moreover, e-mail can help me keep in touch with my classmates or colleagues who work on different projects or assignments. i can easily exchange information, feedback, or suggestions with them through e-mail. therefore, e-mail is a great way to maintain and enhance relationships with people who are not physically close.",
      "Outcome6": "Writing e-mail not only helps people express honestly, but also fluently. unlike face-to-face conversations, which can be influenced by emotions, gestures, or interruptions, e-mail allows people to organize their thoughts and choose their words carefully. they can also revise and edit their messages before sending them, which can improve their clarity and accuracy. e-mail also gives people more time to think and respond, which can reduce misunderstandings and conflicts. therefore, e-mail can be a powerful and effective way of communication for many purposes and situations."

      "Left": "While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.",
      "Right": "Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The generation differences are presented in every way, not only in the external aspects such as technology, culture, and lifestyle, but also in the internal aspects such as values, attitudes, and aspirations. each generation faces its own challenges and opportunities, and has to cope with the changing environment and expectations. in this essay, i will discuss two major challenges that this generation is facing, which are different from the last generation. the first challenge is the global competition and the second challenge is the self-recognition issue.",
      "Outcome2": "These generation differences not only shape the personal identities and goals of young people, but also affect the relationships and interactions between people of different ages. on one hand, young people may face more conflicts and misunderstandings with their parents or elders who have different values and expectations. they may also feel more pressure and competition from their peers who have diverse talents and ambitions. on the other hand, young people may also benefit from the diversity and creativity of this generation. they may learn from the experiences and wisdom of their elders, and collaborate with their peers to solve the problems and challenges of the modern world. they may also have more opportunities and resources to pursue their passions and interests, and to express their individuality and voice.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the most distinctive challenges for this generation is the environmental crisis that threatens the future of the planet and humanity. unlike the last generation, who enjoyed the benefits of rapid economic growth and technological development without much regard for the ecological consequences, this generation is facing the harsh realities of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and resource depletion. this generation has to cope with the impacts of these problems on their health, livelihoods, and security, as well as take actions to reduce their environmental footprint and advocate for sustainable solutions. this challenge requires not only scientific knowledge and innovation, but also ethical awareness and global citizenship.",
      "Outcome4": "One of the most evident ways that the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation is the environmental crisis. the previous generation witnessed the rapid development of industrialization, urbanization, and globalization, which brought about many benefits but also many harms to the natural environment. the current generation is facing the consequences of climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and resource depletion, which threaten their health, security, and well-being. unlike the previous generation, which was largely unaware or indifferent to the environmental problems, this generation is more aware and active in seeking solutions. they are more conscious of their ecological footprint, more willing to adopt sustainable lifestyles, and more vocal in demanding environmental justice and action from governments and corporations. they are also more innovative and collaborative in using technology, science, and social media to address the environmental challenges. however, the environmental crisis is not only a technical problem, but also a moral and cultural one. it requires this generation to question their values, beliefs, and identities, and to find a balance between their individual and collective interests. this leads to the second challenge that this generation is encountering, which is the self-recognition issue.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the main aspects that show the generation differences is the challenges that each generation faces. the last generation had to deal with the aftermath of wars, economic crises, and social conflicts that threatened their survival and stability. they had to work hard, sacrifice, and adapt to the changing world. they had to cope with the lack of resources, opportunities, and information. they had to follow the norms, values, and expectations of their families and society. however, this generation is facing a different set of challenges that are more related to their identity, creativity, and diversity.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main aspects that illustrate the generation differences is the challenges that each generation faces. the last generation had to deal with the hardships of war, poverty, and social unrest, while this generation is enjoying the benefits of peace, prosperity, and globalization. however, this does not mean that this generation has no problems to overcome. on the contrary, this generation has its own unique and complex challenges that require different skills and attitudes."

      "Outcome2": "One of the main reasons why i think technology has improved communication is that it offers a variety of options for people to interact with each other. for instance, people can use social media platforms, such as facebook, instagram, or twitter, to share their opinions, interests, and experiences with a global audience. they can also use instant messaging apps, such as whatsapp, telegram, or signal, to chat with their friends and family anytime and anywhere. moreover, people can use video conferencing software, such as zoom, skype, or google meet, to have face-to-face conversations with their colleagues, classmates, or relatives who live in different countries. these communication tools not only facilitate information exchange, but also foster social relationships.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the main benefits of using technology for communication is that it enables people to overcome the barriers of distance and time. technology allows people to share information, opinions, emotions, and experiences with others across the globe, regardless of their location and time zone. for example, people can use video calls, social media, and online platforms to interact with their family, friends, colleagues, and customers in real time or asynchronously. this can enhance their personal and professional relationships, as well as their cultural awareness and understanding. however, technology also has some drawbacks for communication. for instance, some people may rely too much on technology and neglect face-to-face interactions, which can affect their social skills and emotional well-being. moreover, technology can also create misunderstandings, conflicts, and privacy issues, as people may misinterpret the tone, intention, and context of the messages they receive or send. furthermore, technology can also expose people to cyberbullying, fraud, and harassment, which can harm their mental and physical health. therefore, technology for communication has both advantages and disadvantages, and people should use it wisely and responsibly.",
      "Outcome4": "However, not everyone agrees that technology has improved the quality of human relationships. some people argue that making friends via the internet is not as meaningful or satisfying as face-to-face interactions. they claim that online communication lacks the emotional and physical cues that are essential for building trust and intimacy. moreover, they point out the risks of cyberbullying, fraud, and deception that can occur in the virtual world.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the main advantages of technology in communication is that it has enabled people to overcome the barriers of distance and time. nowadays, the earth has become like a small village, where people can interact with each other across continents and cultures. through various platforms such as social media, video calls, and online forums, people can share their opinions, experiences, and interests with a wider audience. this can enhance their knowledge, awareness, and empathy for different perspectives and issues.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main benefits of technology is that it has enabled people to communicate across distances and cultures that were previously unimaginable. through various platforms such as social media, online forums, video calls, and instant messaging, people can share their opinions, experiences, and interests with others who may live in different countries or continents. this can foster a sense of global awareness, understanding, and solidarity, as well as enrich one's personal and professional life."

      "Outcome2": "Advertisements not only influence people's consumption habits, but also their self-esteem and identity. by constantly showing images of perfect and glamorous people, they create unrealistic and harmful standards of beauty and success that most people cannot attain. for example, women may feel pressured to have flawless skin, thin bodies, and fashionable clothes, while men may feel insecure about their muscles, height, or wealth. these standards can lead to low self-confidence, body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, depression, or anxiety. moreover, advertisements can also manipulate people's values and preferences by associating certain products or behaviors with desirable outcomes. for example, a movie may portray smoking as a sign of coolness, rebellion, or romance, and make people who do not smoke feel left out or inferior. thus, advertisements can have a negative impact on people's mental and physical health, as well as their social and moral choices.",

      "Outcome6": "Advertisements in television and movies are not only a source of income for the media industry, but also a powerful tool of persuasion and influence. they use various techniques to appeal to the emotions, desires, and insecurities of the viewers, and to convince them that they need to buy or do certain things to achieve happiness, success, or social acceptance. however, these advertisements often create unrealistic and harmful standards of beauty, health, and lifestyle that can have negative effects on the self-esteem, well-being, and behavior of the audience."

      "Outcome1": "Some people prefer to work individually, while others enjoy collaborating with others in a team. the choice of working style may depend on various factors, such as personal preferences, skills, goals, and situations. in this essay, i will argue that individual work suits me better than team work, because of my type of temper, learning style, and sense of responsibility. to begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. being by nature introvert, i have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. once, when i was working on presentation with strangers, i sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.",
      "Outcome2": "Not only do i feel more comfortable working alone, but i also achieve better results when i do so. individual work allows me to focus on my own strengths and interests, and to manage my own pace and deadlines. for example, when i had to write a research paper for a course, i chose a topic that fascinated me and did a thorough literature review, analysis, and discussion on my own. i received a high grade and positive feedback from my instructor, who praised my originality and depth of understanding. in contrast, when i had to collaborate with others on a group project, i often faced difficulties in communicating my ideas, resolving conflicts, and meeting expectations. i felt frustrated and stressed by the lack of coordination and clarity among the team members, and the quality of our work suffered. therefore, individual work suits my temper better than team work.",
      "Outcome3": "However, individual work is not always the best option for every task or context. sometimes, team work can offer more benefits and opportunities than working alone. for example, when the goal is to generate diverse ideas, solve complex problems, or complete large-scale projects, team work can provide more perspectives, creativity, and resources than individual work. additionally, team work can foster communication, collaboration, and interpersonal skills that are essential for many careers and situations. therefore, depending on the nature and purpose of the work, i might prefer team work over individual work or vice versa.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, i prefer individual work to team work because of my introverted personality. working alone allows me to focus on the task without the stress of socializing and adapting to unfamiliar environments. moreover, i can achieve better results when i work at my own pace and according to my own preferences. therefore, my type of temper is a key factor that influences my choice of work style.",
      "Outcome5": "In addition to the type of temper, another factor that influences my preference for individual work is the level of autonomy and creativity that i can enjoy. when i work alone, i can set my own pace, goals, and methods without having to compromise or negotiate with others. i can also explore different ideas and perspectives that might not be shared or appreciated by teammates. for instance, when i was assigned to write a report on a topic that i was passionate about, i was able to research and analyze various sources and arguments that enriched my understanding and writing. therefore, i feel more satisfied and motivated when i can exercise my own judgment and initiative in my work.",
      "Outcome6": "Another factor that influences my preference for individual work is the level of control and responsibility that i have over the tasks. when i work alone, i can plan, organize, and execute the work according to my own standards and expectations, without depending on others or compromising on quality. i also feel more accountable and motivated to achieve the goals that i set for myself, as i know that the results depend solely on my efforts and skills. on the contrary, when i work in a team, i often face challenges such as communication gaps, conflicting opinions, unequal workloads, and unclear roles and expectations. these issues can hamper the efficiency and effectiveness of the team work and cause frustration and dissatisfaction. therefore, i prefer to work individually when i have the autonomy and authority to manage the work as i see fit."

As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests."

      "Left": "Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings.",
      "Right": "Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The main contention that no additional payment should be charged on drivers is based on the premise that they have already paid enough for owning and using their vehicles. it is unfair and unreasonable to impose another fee on them for driving during the rush hours, when they may have no other choice but to commute to work or school. such a fee would not only discourage car ownership, but also create more hardship and inequality for the lower and middle income families who rely on cars for their daily transportation.",
      "Outcome2": "One might argue that drivers should pay more for using the roads during peak hours, as they contribute to traffic congestion and air pollution, which affect the quality of life and health of other city dwellers. however, this argument ignores the fact that drivers are not the only ones who benefit from the convenience and mobility of cars. for many families, especially those who live in suburban areas or have to commute long distances for work or school, cars are a necessity rather than a luxury. they enable them to access more opportunities and services, such as education, health care, entertainment, and social activities, that might not be available or accessible by public transport. moreover, drivers already pay a significant amount of taxes and fees for owning and operating their cars, such as registration, insurance, maintenance, and fuel. these costs reflect the social and environmental impacts of their car use, and also help to fund the development and improvement of road infrastructure and public transport. therefore, imposing an extra fee on drivers during rush hours would be unfair and unreasonable, as it would penalize them for exercising their right to mobility and freedom of choice.",
      "Outcome3": "Some might argue that charging drivers extra fee during the rush hours is a necessary measure to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, which are serious problems that affect the health and well-being of urban residents. they might claim that drivers should pay for the negative externalities of their choices, such as greenhouse gas emissions, noise, and accidents, and that the fee would encourage them to use public transportation or other alternatives. they might also point out that the fee would generate revenue for the government to invest in improving the infrastructure and services of the city.",
      "Outcome4": "Therefore, the argument that drivers should pay extra fee during the rush hours is not convincing. it ignores the fact that drivers have already paid a lot for buying and maintaining their cars, and that they use them for legitimate and reasonable purposes. it also fails to consider the negative impacts of such a policy on the drivers' welfare and rights. my contention is that drivers should not be subject to any additional payment for using their cars in the peak hours, as this would be unfair and ineffective.",
      "Outcome5": "In addition to the environmental concerns, some critics also argue that charging drivers extra fee during the rush hours would reduce the traffic congestion and encourage the use of public transportation. however, this argument ignores the practical difficulties and unfairness that such a policy would entail.",
      "Outcome6": "One might argue that drivers should pay extra fee during the rush hours to discourage them from using cars and to reduce the traffic congestion and air pollution. however, this argument overlooks the fact that drivers have already paid a lot to own and use their cars, and that they have legitimate reasons to choose this mode of transportation."

      "Outcome2": "Museums are a great way to learn about a new place when traveling. by seeing the artifacts, documents, and photos that show the culture and the events of the left text is primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. last year, i went to ellis island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of american immigration and the immigrant experience in the new york. through the exhibit, i found that the statue of liberty symbolized freedom, and ellis island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place. for example, when i visited washington d.c., i went to the national museum of african american history and culture, where i learned about the struggles and achievements of african americans throughout the history of the united states. i saw the exhibits that displayed the artifacts of slavery, segregation, civil rights, and cultural expressions. i also learned about the contributions of african americans to the fields of science, art, sports, and politics. the museum gave me a deeper understanding of the diversity and the resilience of the american people.",
      "Outcome3": "Museums are not only sources of knowledge and culture, but also attractions that enrich our travel experience. however, some people may prefer to rely on online travel guides to plan their trips, rather than visiting museums in person. online travel guides may seem convenient and accessible, but they also have some disadvantages that can limit our understanding and enjoyment of a new place.",
      "Outcome4": "Online travel guides can provide useful information and tips for travelers who want to explore a new place, but they cannot replace the experience of visiting museums. museums offer a deeper and more authentic insight into the history, culture, and art of a place, as well as a chance to see and touch artifacts and exhibits that online sources cannot replicate. for example, when i visited ellis island and the immigration museum in new york, i learned about the symbolisms of the statue of liberty and the struggles and hopes of the immigrants who passed through there. online travel guides could not convey the same emotions and impressions that i felt when i saw the actual documents, photographs, and objects that told their stories. therefore, i think that museums are still valuable and irreplaceable sources of learning and enjoyment for travelers.",
      "Outcome5": "When i travel to a new place, i like to visit museums to learn more about the culture and the history of the area. museums can provide me with valuable information and insights that i cannot get from other sources. for example, when i visited new york last year, i went to ellis island and the immigration museum, which is a symbol of american immigration and the immigrant experience. through the exhibit, i found out how the statue of liberty symbolized freedom, and how ellis island was the place where immigrants brought their dreams and fears. thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.",
      "Outcome6": "Besides learning from museums, another way to explore a new place is to experience the local culture and lifestyle. by interacting with the people, tasting the food, and joining the activities, we can gain a deeper understanding of the diversity and richness of the world. for example, when i visited new york, i enjoyed walking along the streets, watching the broadway shows, and trying the famous pizza and bagels. i also met some friendly and helpful locals who shared their stories and opinions with me. therefore, experiencing the local culture and lifestyle can make our trips more enjoyable and meaningful."

      "Outcome1": "Advertising is a powerful tool that can influence people's behavior, preferences and values. however, not all kinds of advertising are appropriate or beneficial for the society, especially for the young and vulnerable groups. in this essay, i will argue that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.",
      "Outcome2": "Advertising alcohol, cigarettes and adult content is harmful to society and children in particular because it can influence their attitudes, behaviors and health. exposure to such ads can normalize and glamorize the use of addictive and risky substances, create false expectations and desires, and undermine the development of critical thinking and self-esteem. moreover, children are more vulnerable and impressionable than adults and may not have the ability to discern the persuasive intent and the negative consequences of such ads. therefore, it is important to protect children from the harmful effects of advertising alcohol, cigarettes and adult content by prohibiting it. first of all, i do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.",
      "Outcome3": "Therefore, i believe that banning such harmful and inappropriate ads is a necessary measure to protect our children from the influence of these products and services. however, not everyone agrees with this view. some people argue that prohibiting these ads is a violation of freedom of expression and that consumers have the right to make their own choices. in the next paragraph, i will examine the main objections and weaknesses of this counterargument.",
      "Outcome4": "However, some people may argue that banning ads for alcohol, cigarettes, and adult materials is a violation of free speech and consumer choice. they may claim that consumers have the right to access information and make their own decisions about what products and services they want to buy and use. they may also contend that advertisers have the freedom to express their opinions and persuade their target audience. however, this argument ignores the fact that these kind of ads can have harmful consequences for the society, especially for the children and adolescents who are more vulnerable and impressionable. studies have shown that exposure to ads for alcohol and tobacco can increase the likelihood of underage drinking and smoking, which can lead to addiction, health problems, and social issues. furthermore, ads for adult materials can promote unrealistic and unhealthy expectations of sexuality, violence, and gender roles, which can affect the self-esteem, relationships, and well-being of young people. therefore, banning these ads is not a restriction of free speech or consumer choice, but a protection of public health and safety.",
      "Outcome5": "However, not all countries have the same regulations and policies regarding the advertising of these harmful and inappropriate products. in some places, the media is flooded with commercials and billboards that promote alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content, without any regard for the health and moral implications of their messages. this creates a situation where children and teenagers are exposed to these ads and may develop curiosity, interest or even addiction to these substances or behaviors. therefore, i believe that there should be a global effort to ban or restrict the advertising of alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content, in order to protect the well-being and development of our young generation.",
      "Outcome6": "However, not all countries have the same regulations and restrictions on advertising harmful or inappropriate products. some advertisers use various techniques and strategies to appeal to consumers, especially young and impressionable ones, and persuade them to buy their products. they might use celebrities, humor, sex appeal, emotional appeals, or false or misleading claims to attract attention and create desire. these kind of ads can have harmful consequences for the physical, mental, and social health of the viewers, especially children, who might not have the critical thinking skills or the moral guidance to resist them."

      "Left": "Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.",

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Another negative effect of international tourism on the destination countries is the environmental degradation caused by the massive influx of visitors and the lack of proper management. many natural attractions, such as coral reefs, rainforests, and wildlife habitats, are vulnerable to the pollution, overexploitation, and disturbance caused by tourists and their activities. for instance, in bali, indonesia, the rapid development of tourism infrastructure and facilities has led to the loss of agricultural land, water scarcity, and waste disposal problems. moreover, some tourists may not respect the local environmental norms and values, and engage in activities that harm the ecosystems and biodiversity. for example, some tourists may feed or touch the wildlife, litter or damage the natural sites, or consume endangered species. these behaviors not only harm the environment, but also the local communities that depend on it for their livelihoods and well-being. therefore, this shows that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.",
      "Outcome2": "Not only can tourism change the cultural identity of the tourist destinations, but it can also harm the local traditions and values that are essential for the preservation of the sociocultural environment. for instance, in some places, tourists may disrespect the religious beliefs, customs, or dress codes of the host communities, causing offense and resentment. alternatively, tourists may influence the local people to adopt their lifestyles, values, or consumption patterns, leading to the loss of cultural diversity and authenticity. furthermore, tourism can also create conflicts and inequalities among the local people, as some may benefit more from the economic opportunities, while others may suffer from the environmental degradation, social displacement, or exploitation. thus, tourism can have detrimental effects on the cultural and social aspects of the destination countries.",
      "Outcome3": "Not only does international tourism affect the cultural identity of the destination countries, but it also poses serious threats to their natural environments. tourism activities often generate large amounts of pollution, waste, and greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming and environmental degradation. moreover, tourism development may require the clearing of forests, wetlands, and other natural habitats, resulting in the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. for instance, in indonesia, tourism-related infrastructure and palm oil plantations have caused the deforestation of millions of hectares of rainforest, endangering the survival of many endemic species, such as orangutans, tigers, and elephants. therefore, this shows that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.",
      "Outcome4": "As the essay has shown, international tourism can have serious consequences for the cultural identity and environmental sustainability of the host countries. tourism can introduce foreign influences that may erode the local traditions, values, and morals, as well as generate excessive waste, pollution, and resource consumption that may harm the natural habitats and biodiversity. these impacts can undermine the quality of life and well-being of the local communities, as well as the attractiveness and competitiveness of the tourism destinations. therefore, it is imperative that the authorities implement effective measures to regulate, monitor, and mitigate the negative effects of tourism. in the following paragraph, i will restate my opinion and provide some recommendations for improving the situation.",
      "Outcome5": "However, the cultural identity of the tourist destinations is not the only thing that is affected by international tourism. another serious problem is the environmental degradation caused by the massive influx of visitors and the unsustainable practices of the tourism industry. for instance, many natural attractions such as coral reefs, rainforests, and wildlife habitats are damaged or destroyed by overexploitation, pollution, and climate change. moreover, the tourism sector often consumes large amounts of water, energy, and land resources, creating waste and greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. these environmental impacts not only threaten the biodiversity and ecological balance of the destination countries, but also reduce the quality and attractiveness of the tourism products and services.",
      "Outcome6": "However, the cultural identity of the tourist destinations is not the only thing at risk from international tourism. another serious issue is the environmental degradation caused by the massive influx of visitors and the development of tourism infrastructure. for instance, the coral reefs in australia and the maldives are suffering from coral bleaching, pollution, overfishing, and physical damage from boats and divers. these ecosystems are vital for the biodiversity and the livelihoods of the local communities, but they are also very fragile and sensitive to changes in temperature, acidity, and salinity. moreover, the tourism industry often consumes a lot of water, energy, and land resources, which can lead to deforestation, soil erosion, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste disposal problems. these environmental problems not only affect the natural beauty and the quality of life of the host countries, but also threaten the sustainability and the competitiveness of the tourism sector itself."

This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe."

      "Outcome2": "However, supporters of zoos claim that they have many benefits for both animals and humans. zoos can contribute to conservation, education and research on endangered species by providing safe habitats, breeding programs, public awareness and scientific knowledge. for example, zoos can help protect animals from poaching, habitat loss and climate change by creating suitable conditions and monitoring their health and behavior. zoos can also educate visitors about the threats and needs of different animals and inspire them to take action for conservation. furthermore, zoos can cooperate with other institutions and researchers to conduct studies and experiments on animal behavior, physiology, genetics and diseases, which can improve their welfare and survival. thus, zoos can play a vital role in preserving biodiversity and enhancing our understanding of the natural world.",
      "Outcome3": "However, not everyone agrees with the view that zoos are unethical and harmful for animals. some supporters of zoology claim that zoos have many benefits for both animals and humans. they argue that zoos can help conserve endangered species, educate the public about wildlife, and conduct scientific research. they also contend that zoos can provide animals with a safe and comfortable environment, where they are protected from predators, poachers, and habitat loss. moreover, they assert that zoos can enrich the animals' lives by offering them stimulation, companionship, and veterinary care.",
      "Outcome4": "However, this view ignores the fact that zoos can also play a positive role in enhancing animal welfare and rights. zoos can provide animals with spacious and naturalistic habitats that mimic their original environments and meet their physical and behavioral needs. zoos can also offer animals a varied and nutritious diet, as well as regular veterinary care and preventive health measures. moreover, zoos can contribute to the conservation and protection of endangered species by participating in breeding programs, reintroduction projects, and research and education initiatives. zoos can also raise public awareness and empathy for animals and their plight in the wild, and inspire people to take action for their conservation. therefore, zoos are not necessarily wrong or unfair for animals, but rather can be beneficial and respectful of their dignity and rights.",
      "Outcome5": "However, supporters of zoology have different views on the role and benefits of zoos. they claim that zoos are important for conservation, education and research purposes. by keeping endangered species in captivity, zoos can protect them from poaching, habitat loss and climate change. they can also participate in breeding programs and reintroduction projects to increase the genetic diversity and population size of these animals. moreover, zoos can educate the public about the diversity and value of wildlife and inspire them to take action for conservation. zoos can also provide opportunities for scientific studies and collaborations that can enhance the understanding and welfare of animals.",
      "Outcome6": "However, supporters of zoology have different views on the role and benefits of zoos. they claim that zoos are not only a source of entertainment and education for the public, but also a vital tool for conservation and research. by keeping animals in captivity, zoos can protect them from poaching, habitat loss, and climate change, which are some of the major threats to wildlife in the wild. moreover, zoos can contribute to the scientific knowledge and welfare of animals by conducting studies, breeding programs, and rescue operations. zoos can also raise awareness and inspire people to care for and respect animals and their natural habitats."

      "Outcome2": "Moreover, working outside the home can also bring benefits for women's personal development and social recognition. there are many examples of successful women who have both a career and a family, such as angela merkel, the chancellor of germany, oprah winfrey, the media mogul and philanthropist, and sheryl sandberg, the chief operating officer of facebook. these women have proven that they can excel in their fields of expertise, while also taking care of their families and their own well-being. they have inspired many other women to pursue their dreams and ambitions, without sacrificing their roles as mothers, wives, or daughters.",
      "Outcome3": "However, working women may also face some challenges and difficulties in balancing their roles and responsibilities. for example, they may have to deal with the pressure of meeting deadlines, managing stress, and maintaining their professional skills. they may also have to cope with the guilt of leaving their children in the care of others, the expectations of their families and society, and the potential conflicts with their husbands over household chores and decision making. therefore, working women need to have a clear sense of their priorities, goals, and values, and seek support and cooperation from their partners, employers, and communities.",

      "Outcome5": "Another reason why women should work is that it can enhance their personal development and social status. by working outside the home, women can gain more knowledge, skills, and confidence, which can benefit them in their career and life. moreover, working women can also have more opportunities to interact with different people and expand their social network, which can enrich their experience and perspective. working women can also have more influence and voice in the society, as they can participate in various social activities and movements. therefore, working can empower women and make them more independent and respected.",
      "Outcome6": "However, working outside the home does not mean that women neglect their domestic responsibilities. women still have to take care of their children, their husbands, and their households. fortunately, working women can rely on various factors that help them balance housework and work. for example, the government's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework can reduce the burden on women. moreover, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women, which can give them more flexibility and control over their time and income."

      "Outcome3": "One way that educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children is by designing activities and assignments that require collaboration and communication among students. for example, some schools use project-based learning, where students work in groups to solve real-world problems or create products that demonstrate their learning. this approach fosters skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving, as well as social and emotional competencies such as empathy, respect, and responsibility. another example is peer tutoring, where students help each other with academic tasks, such as reading, writing, or math. this method not only boosts academic achievement, but also enhances self-esteem, motivation, and interpersonal relationships. by engaging in these kinds of co-operative activities, children learn to appreciate the benefits of teamwork and mutual help, as well as the challenges and opportunities that arise from working with others.",

      "Left": "With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.",
      "Right": "Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles."

      "Outcome1": "One of the main reasons why people follow fashion trends is that they can help them express their identities and personalities in different social contexts. for example, by wearing clothes that suit their age, profession, and culture, people can convey a sense of confidence, competence, and respect. likewise, by adopting styles that reflect their hobbies, interests, and values, people can communicate their individuality, creativity, and diversity. fashion trends, therefore, provide people with a variety of options and inspirations to showcase their personal traits and preferences, while also respecting the norms and expectations of their surroundings.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the main reasons why fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles is that they can influence people's attitudes, moods, and confidence levels. for example, wearing fashionable clothes can make people feel more confident and attractive, which can boost their self-esteem and performance in various situations. moreover, following fashion trends can help people express their personalities and preferences, as well as communicate with others who share similar tastes and interests. fashion trends can also reflect the social and cultural changes of different times and places, which can enrich people's knowledge and awareness of the world. therefore, fashion trends can have a positive impact on people's psychological and emotional well-being.",
      "Outcome3": "Following fashion trends, therefore, not only helps people express their individuality and social identity, but also enhances their confidence and self-esteem. however, some people may argue that dressing in a personal style is more authentic and creative than conforming to the mainstream fashion. they believe that personal dressing styles reflect one's personality, values, and preferences, and that they can avoid being influenced by the commercialization and homogenization of fashion. in the following paragraphs, i will examine the merits and drawbacks of personal dressing styles and explain why i still favor fashion trends.",
      "Outcome4": "Admittedly, personal dressing styles have some advantages over following fashion trends. they can reflect one's uniqueness, creativity, and authenticity, and express one's personality and preferences. they can also help one stand out from the crowd and avoid being stereotyped or influenced by others. however, personal dressing styles also have limitations and challenges. they may not suit different occasions, seasons, or cultures, and may cause misunderstandings or conflicts with others. they may also require more time, money, and effort to maintain and update, and may not always be appreciated or accepted by the public. therefore, personal dressing styles are not necessarily superior or easier than following fashion trends.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the main reasons why fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles is that they provide guidance and inspiration for those who are interested in fashion but lack the skills or confidence to create their own looks. by following fashion trends, such people can learn from the experts and celebrities who set the standards of beauty and taste in different cultures and contexts. they can also discover new combinations and possibilities that suit their preferences and personalities, as well as experiment with different styles and accessories.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main reasons why fashion trends are more important than personal dressing styles is that they reflect the cultural and social values of different times and places. by following fashion trends, people can show their respect and appreciation for the diverse and dynamic expressions of human creativity and identity. fashion trends also help people to communicate with others who share similar tastes and interests, and to create a sense of belonging and community."

      "Outcome3": "Technology not only facilitates the acquisition of foreign language skills, but also enables learners to explore the cultural aspects of the languages they are studying. by accessing authentic materials, such as films, podcasts, newspapers, and websites, learners can gain insights into the values, beliefs, and customs of the people who speak those languages. moreover, technology can help learners to communicate and interact with native speakers or other learners from different countries and backgrounds, thus exposing them to diverse perspectives and experiences.",
      "Outcome4": "Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign language in our own country. a large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages. however, learning a foreign language is not only about mastering the grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation, but also about understanding the culture and the context of the speakers. culture influences the way we learn and use foreign languages in many ways, such as the expressions, gestures, values, and norms that are embedded in the communication. therefore, it is important to expose ourselves to the authentic and diverse cultural aspects of the foreign language we are learning, and to be aware of the similarities and differences between our own culture and the target culture.",
      "Outcome5": "In addition to the benefits of travel and cultural exchange, learning a foreign language can also be facilitated by the use of technology. nowadays, learners can access a wide range of online resources and platforms that can help them improve their skills and knowledge. for example, they can enroll in foreign language courses that are offered by reputable institutions or instructors, and follow their own pace and schedule. they can also interact with other learners or native speakers through various forums, chat rooms, or social media, and practice their speaking and listening abilities. technology has thus reduced the gap between learning a foreign language in our own country and in the target country, and has made it more convenient and affordable.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the benefits of learning a foreign language in our own country is that we can access a variety of sources and materials to enrich our knowledge and skills. however, learning a foreign language also involves interacting with native speakers and experiencing the culture and context of the target language. this is where technology can help us overcome the geographical and temporal barriers that may limit our exposure and practice."

      "Outcome2": "Communicating with other students can also enhance the learning outcomes of attending classes, as it enables students to exchange ideas, clarify doubts, and reinforce concepts. by discussing the new material with their peers, students can deepen their understanding, identify gaps in their knowledge, and find different perspectives and approaches to solve problems. moreover, communication can foster a sense of collaboration and support among students, which can motivate them to persist in their studies and overcome challenges. therefore, by attending classes, students can benefit from the social and cognitive aspects of communication, which can improve their academic performance and skills.",
      "Outcome3": "Another advantage of attending classes regularly is that it fosters a sense of responsibility and diligence in students. by appearing in class, students have to follow the rules and expectations of their instructors and peers, such as being punctual, respectful, attentive, and participatory. these habits can help them develop self-discipline and professionalism that are essential for their academic and career success. moreover, attending classes also requires students to complete their assignments on time and with quality, which can enhance their skills of time management, research, analysis, and problem-solving. in contrast, students who study at home may lack the motivation and guidance to adhere to the standards and deadlines of their courses, and may struggle to cope with the challenges and complexities of the subject matter. therefore, attending classes can help students become more conscientious and persistent in their learning process.",
      "Outcome4": "Another aspect that differentiates the students who study at home and the ones who attend classes is their study discipline and time management. being present at classes requires students to follow a certain schedule and to submit their assignments on time. this helps them to develop a sense of responsibility and to organize their study materials effectively. on the contrary, the ones who study at home have more flexibility and freedom in choosing when and how to study. this may lead to procrastination, distraction, or lack of motivation. as a result, they may not cover the essential topics or meet the deadlines. therefore, attending classes can enhance students' academic performance and skills by imposing some structure and order on their learning process.",
      "Outcome5": "Being present at classes not only enhances students' communication and collaboration skills, but also fosters their sense of responsibility and diligence. on the contrary, studying at home may deprive them of the benefits of peer learning and the structure of academic expectations. moreover, attending classes has another advantage that cannot be ignored: it exposes students to different perspectives and insights from their instructors and classmates. this can enrich their knowledge and stimulate their critical thinking, as well as prepare them for the challenges and opportunities in their future careers. however, if they do not attend classes, they may miss out on these valuable learning experiences and limit their own potential.",
      "Outcome6": "Furthermore, attending classes can enhance students' academic performance by exposing them to the feedback and guidance of their instructors. by participating in class discussions, asking questions, and receiving clarifications, students can deepen their understanding of the course content and improve their skills. in contrast, those who study at home may lack the interaction and support that can facilitate their learning and help them overcome difficulties. they may also miss out on valuable information and resources that are provided in class."

      "Outcome3": "One of the vital aspects that need to be considered in choosing a job is the potential for professional development and recognition. professional achievements, skills and position can increase job satisfaction and motivation by enhancing one's self-esteem, confidence and sense of purpose. according to a study by herzberg et al. (1959), these factors are among the intrinsic motivators that make people feel good about their work and themselves, while salary is an extrinsic factor that can only prevent dissatisfaction but not create satisfaction. moreover, professional achievements, skills and position can also open up more opportunities for career advancement, learning and networking, which can further enrich one's work experience and personal growth. for instance, a teacher who receives positive feedback from students and colleagues, develops new teaching methods and obtains a higher qualification may feel more fulfilled and motivated than a teacher who only receives a high salary but has no room for improvement or recognition.",

      "Left": "The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.",

      "Outcome1": "Cooperation is not only a moral duty, but also a practical necessity for co-workers. when they cooperate, they can share their skills, knowledge, and ideas to complete their tasks more efficiently and effectively. they can also support each other in times of need, such as covering for each other's absences, helping with deadlines, or solving problems. cooperation also fosters a positive and respectful work culture, where co-workers appreciate each other's contributions and feedback. this enhances their motivation, morale, and loyalty, which in turn improves their performance and satisfaction. on the contrary, when co-workers do not cooperate, they create conflicts, misunderstandings, and resentment, which harm their productivity, quality, and reputation. they also miss out on the opportunities to learn from each other and to grow professionally and personally. therefore, cooperation is vital for co-workers to succeed and enjoy their work life.",
      "Outcome2": "Cooperation among co-workers not only prevents conflicts and problems, but also enhances the quality and efficiency of the work. for instance, when i was working on a project with a tight deadline, i faced some technical difficulties that i could not resolve on my own. fortunately, one of my co-workers who had more experience in that area offered to help me out and shared his knowledge and skills with me. together, we managed to complete the project on time and received appreciation from the client and the manager. this experience boosted my confidence and improved my relationship with my co-worker. therefore, i think cooperation among co-workers is a key factor for success and satisfaction in a work environment.",
      "Outcome3": "In contrast to the uncooperative co-worker who caused disputes and dissatisfaction in the first paragraph, a cooperative co-worker would have been more supportive and understanding of the needs and challenges of his or her colleagues. a cooperative co-worker would have been willing to share the workload, to accommodate reasonable requests, and to communicate effectively with the supervisor and the team. by doing so, a cooperative co-worker would have contributed to a positive and productive work environment, where the tasks are completed efficiently and the quality is maintained. moreover, a cooperative co-worker would have fostered a sense of fellowship among the co-workers, as the second paragraph suggests. this would have enhanced the work life of the co-workers, as they would have felt appreciated, respected, and valued. they would have also developed strong personal relationships that would have enriched their professional and personal growth. therefore, cooperation among co-workers is essential for a successful and satisfying work environment.",
      "Outcome4": "Fellowship among co-workers can enhance their work life and personal relationships in many ways. for example, when co-workers share their joys and sorrows, they can support each other emotionally and mentally. they can also learn from each other's skills and experiences, and help each other to improve their performance and creativity. moreover, when co-workers have a friendly and respectful attitude towards each other, they can avoid conflicts and misunderstandings that can harm their work quality and morale. therefore, fellowship among co-workers can make them more cooperative, productive, and satisfied in their work environment.",
      "Outcome5": "On the other hand, cooperation among co-workers is not only beneficial for completing the tasks efficiently, but also for creating a positive and friendly atmosphere in the workplace. cooperation means respecting each other's opinions, sharing the workload, and helping out when someone is in need. this way, co-workers can avoid conflicts, misunderstandings, and resentment that can harm their performance and morale. moreover, cooperation can foster a sense of fellowship among co-workers, which is essential for enjoying their work life and building strong personal relationships.",
      "Outcome6": "Cooperation among co-workers is not only beneficial for the productivity and quality of work, but also for the morale and well-being of the employees. when co-workers cooperate, they can share their skills, knowledge, and resources, as well as support each other in times of need. moreover, cooperation fosters a sense of trust, respect, and appreciation among co-workers, which can enhance their satisfaction and motivation. on the other hand, when co-workers do not cooperate, they may face conflicts, misunderstandings, and resentment, which can harm their performance and reputation. for example, i had a bad experience with a co-worker who was selfish and unhelpful, and who eventually faced the consequences of his actions. therefore, i value cooperation as a key factor for a successful and harmonious work environment."

      "Outcome3": "The problem of waste accumulation is not only a threat to the marine life and the natural balance of the oceans, but also a source of air pollution. many of the wastes discarded by human contain toxic or non-biodegradable materials, such as plastics, metals, chemicals, and batteries, that can release harmful substances into the atmosphere when they are burned, decomposed, or exposed to sunlight. moreover, some of the wastes, such as organic matter, can produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. therefore, the disposal of wastes in the sea or on land has serious implications for the quality and health of the air we breathe.",
      "Outcome4": "People are corrupting their ecosphere. in recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. these wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a \"new\" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. another serious consequence of human activity is the deterioration of the atmospheric quality. the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change. acid rain damages the soil, the vegetation and the aquatic life, as well as eroding the buildings and monuments. global warming alters the natural balance of the earth, leading to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather events and loss of biodiversity. climate change poses a threat to the survival of many species, including humans, who depend on the stability and predictability of the ecosphere.",
      "Outcome5": "The left text and the right text both illustrate the negative impacts of human activities on the environment. people are corrupting their ecosphere by consuming more resources and producing more waste than the natural systems can handle. the right text provides some examples of how the waste discarded by human, such as household waste and industrial waste, are polluting the sea and the air. the sea is becoming a dumping ground for garbage, creating a \"new\" continent that threatens marine life and ecosystems. the air is becoming contaminated by industrial exhaust gases, causing health problems and environmental issues such as acid rain, global warming or climate change. these phenomena have serious consequences for the biodiversity, the weather patterns, and the quality of life of all living beings.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the most alarming consequences of the human-induced ecosphere corruption is the threat to the biodiversity of the planet. the accumulation of garbage in the sea not only pollutes the water, but also endangers the marine life that ingests or gets entangled in the plastic and other debris. similarly, the emission of greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere not only affects the human health, but also disrupts the natural balance of the ecosystems, leading to the loss of habitats, species extinction, and the spread of invasive and infectious organisms. therefore, the human impact on the environment is not only a moral issue, but also a survival issue, as the degradation of the ecosphere jeopardizes the resources and services that sustain the human civilization."

      "Outcome2": "Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life for several reasons. first, the brain of a child is more flexible and adaptable than that of an adult, which enables them to acquire new linguistic skills more easily. second, children are exposed to various sources of input and feedback, such as parents, teachers, peers, and media, which enhance their language development. third, children have more motivation and curiosity to learn a foreign language, as they are interested in exploring different cultures and perspectives. furthermore, learning a foreign language in the childhood period can have long-term benefits, such as improving cognitive abilities, academic performance, and career opportunities. therefore, it is not surprising that many researchers and educators recommend introducing a foreign language to students in the beginning of their education.",
      "Outcome3": "Learning a foreign language in childhood can have many advantages for the students in their academic, personal, and professional development. by acquiring a foreign language at an early age, students can enhance their cognitive skills, such as memory, creativity, and problem-solving, which can help them in their future studies and careers. moreover, students can develop their intercultural competence, which can enable them to communicate effectively and respectfully with people from different backgrounds and cultures, and to appreciate the diversity and richness of the world. furthermore, students can expand their opportunities and choices in life, as they can access more information, resources, and networks in a globalized society, and pursue their interests and passions in different fields and domains. therefore, learning a foreign language in childhood can be a valuable and rewarding experience for the students, as it can enrich their knowledge, skills, and personality.",
      "Outcome4": "The lack of exposure and practice opportunities. children may not have enough contact with native speakers, authentic materials, or real-life situations where they can use the language they are learning. this may limit their input, output, and feedback, and affect their confidence and fluency. to overcome this challenge, teachers and parents can provide more exposure and practice opportunities for children, such as through online platforms, language clubs, exchange programs, or bilingual education.",
      "Outcome5": "Learning a foreign language is a valuable skill that can enhance one's communication, cultural awareness, and career prospects. however, not everyone has the same opportunity or ease to acquire a new language. some factors that can affect one's language learning ability are the age, motivation, and environment of the learner. in this essay, i will argue that the best time to learn a foreign language is in the childhood period, based on the following reasons. first, the ability of learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. they can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. it is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. by considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language. second, learning a foreign language in the childhood period can also have positive effects on the cognitive, social, and emotional development of the learner.",
      "Outcome6": "Second, learning a foreign language in the childhood period can bring many benefits for the students' future academic and professional development. as the world is becoming more globalized and interconnected, the demand for bilingual or multilingual speakers is increasing in various fields and sectors. students who learn a foreign language from an early age can have more opportunities to access different sources of information, communicate with diverse people and cultures, and enhance their cognitive and creative skills. moreover, they can have an advantage over their peers who start learning a foreign language later in life, as they can achieve higher levels of proficiency and fluency. therefore, learning a foreign language in the childhood period can prepare the students for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century."

      "Outcome2": "Censorship is the practice of suppressing or restricting the expression of certain ideas, images, or messages that are deemed offensive, harmful, or undesirable by some authority. some art works, especially those that deal with controversial topics such as politics, religion, sexuality, or violence, may face censorship from governments, religious institutions, or other groups that seek to control the public discourse and maintain social order. however, censorship also raises ethical and aesthetic issues, as it may violate the freedom of speech and creativity of the artists, and deprive the audiences of the opportunity to access diverse and challenging forms of art. therefore, there is a heated debate on whether censorship is justified or necessary, and what are the criteria and limits for regulating artistic expression.",
      "Outcome3": "The public's ability to judge art works critically is one of the main reasons why artists should be free to create without censorship or interference. art works are not merely passive representations of reality, but also expressions of the artists' perspectives, emotions and creativity. the audiences who encounter these works are not naive or gullible, but have their own experiences, knowledge and opinions that enable them to analyse, evaluate and appreciate the art works in their own ways. they can distinguish between fact and fiction, between propaganda and critique, between beauty and ugliness. they can also engage in dialogue and debate with other audiences, artists and critics, and form their own views on the social, cultural and political issues that the art works raise. therefore, the fear of social misleading is unfounded, as the public is not a homogeneous mass that can be easily manipulated or deceived by art works, but a diverse and active community that can benefit from the artistic freedom and diversity.",
      "Outcome4": "Therefore, artists should be free to create whatever they want, as long as they do not violate the basic rights and dignity of others. by restricting their freedom of expression, the government would not only infringe on their artistic autonomy, but also deprive the public of the opportunity to access diverse and critical perspectives on various issues. for example, a film that depicts the corruption and injustice in a certain regime may be censored or banned by the authorities, but it may also inspire the viewers to question and challenge the status quo. similarly, a novel that explores the complex and controversial aspects of human nature may be deemed immoral or offensive by some groups, but it may also enrich the readers' understanding and empathy for different characters and situations. thus, art can be a powerful tool for social change and education, as well as a source of aesthetic pleasure and entertainment.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, artists should be free to create whatever they want without any censorship or restriction from the authorities. their creation is a form of expression and communication that can enrich the cultural diversity and stimulate the intellectual curiosity of the society. the audiences are not passive recipients of the artists' messages, but active participants who can critically evaluate and respond to them. the fear of social misleading is based on a false assumption that the public is easily manipulated or corrupted by the artistic representation of reality or unreality. on the contrary, the public can distinguish between fact and fiction, and appreciate the artistic value of the creation.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, i contend that artists should be free to create whatever they want without any censorship or restriction from the government or other authorities. art is a form of expression and communication that can enrich our culture, challenge our perspectives and inspire our emotions. by limiting or suppressing art, we are not only violating the artists' rights, but also depriving ourselves of the opportunity to learn, grow and appreciate the diversity of human creativity."

Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete.

When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 28, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days.

      "Outcome2": "Besides strengthening the physical and mental health of individuals, sports also have positive impacts on the social and political aspects of a nation. by participating in or watching sports, people can develop a sense of national identity and solidarity, which can enhance their loyalty, cooperation and mutual respect. this can help to overcome the differences and conflicts that may arise from diverse backgrounds, cultures and interests. moreover, having a strong national identity and solidarity can also boost the confidence and reputation of a nation in the international arena, as well as foster the spirit of fair play and sportsmanship. therefore, sports can be seen as a powerful tool to promote national unity and harmony.",
      "Outcome3": "However, using sports as a tool for patriotism also has some drawbacks or challenges that need to be addressed. first of all, excessive patriotism can lead to nationalism, which is a belief that one's own nation is superior or more deserving than others. this can foster negative stereotypes, prejudice, and hostility towards other countries or groups, especially in the context of international competitions or conflicts. for example, some fans may resort to violence, vandalism, or racism to express their support for their team or their hatred for the opponents. secondly, sports can also be exploited by political or ideological agendas that aim to manipulate public opinion or divert attention from social or economic problems. for example, some governments may use sports as a way to boost their legitimacy, popularity, or propaganda, while neglecting or suppressing the voices and needs of their citizens. moreover, some athletes may face pressure, discrimination, or corruption from the authorities or the media, depending on their performance, background, or views.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, sporting events have significant impacts on both individual and national development. they not only promote physical and mental health, but also foster social cohesion and patriotic feelings. by participating in or watching sports, people can enhance their skills, confidence, teamwork, and respect for others. moreover, they can express their pride and joy for their country and its achievements. therefore, it is undeniable that sport events are beneficial for everyone in many aspects.",
      "Outcome5": "Besides enhancing our physical and mental health, sporting events also have positive impacts on our social and cultural aspects. by participating in or watching sports, we can learn more about other countries and cultures, as well as foster mutual respect and understanding. sports can also promote peace and cooperation among nations, especially when they are held in a fair and friendly manner. for example, the olympic games are often seen as a symbol of global solidarity and harmony, where athletes from different backgrounds and beliefs can compete with each other in a spirit of sportsmanship. moreover, sports can also create a sense of belonging and identity for people who share the same national or regional affiliation.",
      "Outcome6": "Besides enhancing physical and mental health, sporting occasions have another significant benefit: they can foster a sense of national identity and pride. this is especially important in the context of globalization, when many countries face the challenge of preserving their cultural and historical heritage. sporting occasions can help to reinforce the bonds between people who share the same nationality and values."

For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly.

To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions.

      "Outcome3": "It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. for instance, public investment projects such as building new hospitals, upgrading medical equipment, training health workers, expanding vaccination programs, and promoting preventive care can reduce mortality, morbidity, and inequality in health outcomes. similarly, public investment projects such as constructing new schools, providing quality teachers, enhancing curriculum, increasing access to early childhood education, and supporting special needs students can improve learning outcomes, skills, and opportunities for the future generations. apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.",
      "Outcome4": "It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. however, not all governments or communities allocate sufficient resources to these vital sectors, which can have serious repercussions for the well-being of the population. underfunding public services can result in poor infrastructure, equipment, and staff, leading to lower quality and accessibility of health care and education. this can increase the risks of diseases, injuries, and mortality, as well as widen the gaps in skills, knowledge, and opportunities among different groups. moreover, underfunding public services can undermine the social cohesion, trust, and participation that are essential for a democratic and inclusive society. therefore, investing in hospitals and schools is not only a moral duty, but also a smart and strategic decision for the long-term development and prosperity of the nation. investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.",
      "Outcome5": "It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. these sectors not only provide essential care and learning for the citizens, but also contribute to the social and economic development of the country. investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. hence, adequate funding and support for these facilities are crucial to maintain and enhance the quality and accessibility of these services. apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate. therefore, it is in the best interest of the government and the society to allocate sufficient resources and attention to these vital public services.",
      "Outcome6": "It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. these services are essential for ensuring the well-being and development of the population, especially in times of crisis or emergency. investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate."

For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.",

      "Outcome5": "Another way to improve the quality of life in this community is to provide more green spaces and recreational facilities. green spaces can improve the air quality, reduce noise pollution, and offer a place for relaxation and exercise. recreational facilities can enhance the physical and mental health of the residents, as well as create opportunities for social interaction and community engagement. for instance, parks, playgrounds, sports centers, libraries, and museums can attract people of different ages and interests. therefore, having more green spaces and recreational facilities can make this community more livable and enjoyable.",
      "Outcome6": "Another way to improve the quality of life in this community is to encourage people to use bicycles or walk more often. this will not only reduce the air pollution and noise caused by cars, but also promote the health and well-being of the residents. moreover, cycling and walking can help people to enjoy the natural scenery and the local culture of this community, which can enhance their sense of belonging and identity. for instance, people can visit the nearby park, museum, or market by bike or on foot, and interact with their neighbors and friends along the way."

      "Outcome1": "Free education is a desirable goal that can benefit many scholars who are eager to pursue higher studies and contribute to the advancement of knowledge. a famous proverb “knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. i believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. i have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work. moreover, it is hard to manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. mphils and phds scholars are probably engaged in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. the idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.",
      "Outcome2": "Free of cost education can not only make higher studies accessible to more interested scholars, but also improve the quality of their research. according to a study by unesco, countries that offer free or low-fee tertiary education have higher enrollment rates and higher research output than those that charge high fees. for example, norway, which provides free education to all students regardless of nationality, has an enrollment rate of 94% and ranks among the top 20 countries in terms of scientific publications per capita. on the other hand, the united states, which has one of the most expensive higher education systems in the world, has an enrollment rate of 69% and ranks 11th in terms of research output. free education can also reduce the financial burden and stress on scholars, allowing them to focus more on their academic goals and pursue innovative and impactful research.",
      "Outcome3": "Free education can greatly benefit the scholars who are interested in pursuing higher studies and research. by providing free of cost education, universities can reduce the financial burden and stress of the scholars who otherwise have to worry about paying high fees or finding a job to support themselves. this can allow them to focus on their studies and research without any distraction or compromise. free education can also encourage more scholars to apply for good universities and enhance the quality and diversity of the academic community.",
      "Outcome4": "However, some might argue that providing free education to the interested scholars would be unfair to those who have worked hard to pay their fees or to the universities that need to cover their operational costs and maintain their standards. they might also claim that free education would reduce the motivation and commitment of the scholars or lower the quality and competitiveness of the academic programs. these arguments, however, are not convincing enough to outweigh the benefits of free education. first of all, free education does not mean that the scholars would not have to meet any academic requirements or criteria to enroll or graduate from the universities. they would still have to demonstrate their merit, potential, and passion for their fields of study. secondly, free education does not imply that the universities would lose their funding or reputation. on the contrary, they could attract more talented and diverse scholars from different backgrounds and regions, who could contribute to the advancement of knowledge and innovation. they could also seek alternative sources of income, such as donations, grants, partnerships, or endowments, to support their missions and goals. thirdly, free education does not diminish the value or the challenge of the academic programs. rather, it enables the scholars to focus more on their learning and research, without worrying about the financial burden or the trade-off between work and study. it also fosters a culture of collaboration and solidarity among the scholars, who could share their resources, ideas, and experiences. therefore, free education is not only a right, but also a responsibility and an opportunity for the interested scholars and the universities.",
      "Outcome5": "A famous proverb “knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. i believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. i have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work. therefore, free education would not only remove the financial barrier for the deserving students, but also enable them to focus on their academic goals and aspirations. moreover, it is hard to manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. mphils and phds scholars are probably engaged in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. the idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.",
      "Outcome6": "However, the high cost of education is not the only obstacle that prevents many scholars from pursuing their academic goals. another challenge is the difficulty of balancing work and study, especially for those who are involved in advanced research."

It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.",
      "Right": "Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind."

      "Outcome1": "One of the most controversial topics in modern society is whether or not to eat meat. since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein source. meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. recent years, however, have seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. it is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and religious aspect. in this essay, i will discuss how these two factors influence people's dietary choices and why they are more important than other arguments.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the most common reasons that some people choose to abstain from meat is the care for animal rights issue. they argue that animals are sentient beings that deserve respect and compassion, and that killing them for food is cruel and unethical. they also point out the environmental and social impacts of the meat industry, such as deforestation, pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and animal suffering. by adopting a vegetarian diet, they hope to reduce their ecological footprint, promote a more humane and peaceful world, and express their moral values.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the most common reasons why people choose to abstain from meat is the health benefits that they can obtain from a vegetarian diet. numerous studies have shown that vegetarians have lower risks of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and some types of cancer. for example, a meta-analysis of 86 studies found that vegetarians had a 25% lower mortality rate from ischemic heart disease than non-vegetarians. moreover, a vegetarian diet can provide adequate amounts of essential nutrients such as protein, iron, calcium, and vitamin b12, as long as it is well-planned and balanced. by avoiding meat, people can also reduce their exposure to harmful substances such as antibiotics, hormones, and pesticides that are often used in animal farming. therefore, a vegetarian diet can offer significant advantages for one's physical well-being and longevity.",
      "Outcome4": "Apart from health concerns, another important factor that influences people's decision to avoid eating meat is their religious beliefs. many vegetarians and religious followers share a common value of compassion and respect for all living beings, regardless of their species or form. they also aspire to achieve a higher level of spiritual awareness and harmony, which they believe can be enhanced by a plant-based diet. therefore, for some people, being a vegetarian is not only a dietary choice, but also a way of expressing their faith and devotion.",
      "Outcome5": "Apart from the health benefits, another reason why people choose to abstain from meat is their religious beliefs. different religions have different views on the ethical and spiritual implications of consuming animal products. for instance, some followers of buddhism believe that animals were human beings in their previous lives, and that eating their meat means violating the principle of non-violence and compassion. although this perspective may seem unscientific to some, i respect the right of people to follow their own religious practices, which can help them achieve inner peace and wisdom.",
      "Outcome6": "Apart from the health benefits, another common reason that people choose to abstain from meat is their religious convictions. different faiths have different teachings and traditions regarding the consumption of animal products, and some followers adhere to them strictly. for example, one of the most widespread religions that promotes a vegetarian diet is buddhism."

There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing.

      "Outcome1": "Learning by doing things is more exciting and effective than learning by reading or listening. this is the main idea of this essay, which will explore the reasons and examples of why this is true. learning by doing things allows people to experience the sensations, challenges, and rewards of the activities they want to learn, while reading or listening can only provide them with second-hand information and limited understanding. whether it is swimming, cooking, playing an instrument, or any other skill, learning by doing things can help people develop their confidence, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. in contrast, learning by reading or listening can be boring, passive, and superficial. the history of human civilization is full of examples of how learning by doing things has led to discoveries, inventions, and innovations that have changed the world. therefore, learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things.",
      "Outcome2": "Learning by doing things is not only more exciting, but also more effective and rewarding than learning by reading or listening. there are many fields and subjects that require practical experience and skills that cannot be acquired by mere theoretical knowledge. for example, learning a foreign language is much easier and faster when one interacts with native speakers and immerses oneself in the culture, rather than just studying grammar and vocabulary from books or tapes. learning a musical instrument or a sport also involves practicing and performing, not just memorizing notes or rules. learning a craft or a trade, such as carpentry or cooking, requires hands-on work and creativity, not just following instructions or recipes. learning by doing things enables one to discover one's own strengths and weaknesses, to solve problems and overcome challenges, and to enjoy the process and the outcome of learning.",
      "Outcome3": "Learning by doing things is more effective and enjoyable than learning by reading or listening because it engages all the senses and the mind in the learning process. when people do things, they experience the reality of the situation, the challenges, the feedback, and the satisfaction of achieving their goals. they also develop skills, confidence, and creativity that can help them in other aspects of life. learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading or listening because it stimulates curiosity, interest, and motivation. people who do things are more likely to remember what they learned and apply it in different contexts. they also have more fun and enjoyment in learning, which can make them lifelong learners.",
      "Outcome4": "Learning by doing things is not only more exciting than learning by reading or listening, but also more effective and productive. throughout history, many great achievements and inventions have been the result of experimenting, observing, and testing things in practice. for example, the wright brothers learned how to fly by building and flying their own gliders and planes, not by reading books or listening to lectures. similarly, thomas edison learned how to create the light bulb by trying thousands of different materials and methods, not by following existing theories or formulas. these examples show that learning by doing things can stimulate creativity, curiosity, and problem-solving skills, which are essential for learning and advancing in any field. therefore, people should not rely only on reading or listening to learn things, but also engage in active and hands-on learning.",
      "Outcome5": "Learning by doing things is not only more exciting, but also more effective than learning by reading or listening. when people do things themselves, they can experience the challenges, the joys, and the outcomes of their actions. they can also develop their skills, their creativity, and their confidence. learning by reading or listening can provide some information and guidance, but it cannot replace the personal involvement and the feedback that doing things can offer. therefore, learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things, as the history shows.",
      "Outcome6": "Learning by doing things is not only more exciting, but also more effective than learning by reading or listening. by doing things, people can gain practical experience, develop skills, and discover their own abilities and interests. they can also learn from their mistakes and improve their performance. learning by doing things can also motivate people to pursue their goals and passions, and to seek new challenges and opportunities. therefore, learning by doing things is a valuable and rewarding way of acquiring knowledge and wisdom."

      "Outcome1": "In the modern world, pursuing multiple careers is becoming a common phenomenon among the new generations who seek to earn more and to gain financial security. this trend is influenced by several factors, such as the changing nature of work, the advancement of technology, and the unequal distribution of income. the career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. people usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. however, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security. moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. the official term of it is named \"technological unemployment\". north american economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent american economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. for example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. the best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.",
      "Outcome2": "Having a career is often considered a vital part of one's identity and well-being, but in the contemporary world, many people are facing challenges and changes in their professional paths. the career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. people usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. however, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security. what are the factors that influence this trend and how does it affect the economy and society? in this essay, we will examine some of the causes and consequences of having multiple careers in the 21st century, such as technological unemployment, low wages, and personal satisfaction.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the reasons why pursuing multiple careers has become a modern trend is that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and gain multiple higher educational certificates. unlike their predecessors who often settled for a single career as a means of living, they seek to explore different fields, develop diverse skills, and enhance their qualifications. for instance, a person may work as a teacher, a freelance writer, and a graphic designer, while pursuing a master's degree in education or a certification in web development. this way, they can satisfy their curiosity, creativity, and passion for learning, as well as increase their income and employability. moreover, having multiple careers can also help them cope with the uncertainty and volatility of the labor market, as they can adapt to changing demands and opportunities.",
      "Outcome4": "The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. people usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. however, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security. another factor that influences the trend of pursuing multiple careers is the impact of technology on the labor market. technology has been advancing rapidly and transforming various sectors of the economy, creating new opportunities but also displacing many workers from their traditional roles.",
      "Outcome5": "While having a single career was once the norm for most workers, the changing economic and social conditions of the 21st century have challenged this traditional model. as the left text explains, new generations are more inclined to pursue multiple jobs and higher education credentials in order to increase their income and financial security. this is partly a response to the uncertainties and risks posed by the rapid development of technology, which has been displacing many human workers from their occupations. the right text illustrates how technological unemployment is a serious threat to many sectors, such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and manufacturing. therefore, having more skills and options can help workers adapt to the changing labour market and avoid becoming obsolete. another factor that motivates workers to seek more jobs is the unfair compensation system of many corporations, which pay low wages to their inferiors and widen the income gap. by working on different sectors, workers can diversify their sources of income and bargain for better pay.",
      "Outcome6": "Although having a single career was once the norm, the changing economic and social conditions have prompted many people to pursue multiple jobs and educational opportunities. this is not only a matter of personal preference, but also a necessity for survival in a competitive and uncertain market. one of the main factors that contributes to this situation is the impact of technology on the labor force."

      "Outcome2": "One of the main advantages of prohibiting smoking in public places is the improvement of public health and well-being. smoking not only harms the smokers themselves, but also exposes the non-smokers to secondhand smoke, which can cause various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and other health problems. according to the world health organization, secondhand smoke kills more than 600,000 people annually, and is responsible for about 28% of the deaths from lung cancer among non-smokers. by enforcing such a restrain, the government can protect the public from the harmful effects of tobacco smoke, and reduce the burden of health care costs and premature deaths. additionally, banning smoking in public places can also enhance the quality of the environment, by reducing air pollution, littering, and fire hazards.",
      "Outcome3": "Therefore, the ban on smoking in public places has been a successful measure to protect the health and well-being of the non-smoking public in sri lanka. it has also reduced the risk of conflicts and disturbances caused by smokers who disregarded the rights and preferences of others. the second paragraph will further explore the benefits of this policy and suggest that it could be a model for other countries to adopt.",

      "Outcome5": "Enforcing such restrain not only benefits the non-smoking public, but also the smokers themselves. according to the world health organization, smoking is the leading cause of preventable death and disease worldwide, and secondhand smoke exposure increases the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory infections. by banning smoking in public places, sri lanka has reduced the exposure of its population to these harmful effects and encouraged smokers to quit or reduce their consumption. moreover, smoke-free environments also improve the quality of life, air quality, and cleanliness of public spaces, creating a more pleasant and healthy atmosphere for everyone.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, restricting smoking in public places can be seen as a measure that protects the health and well-being of the non-smoking public, as well as promotes a more harmonious and respectful social environment. by reducing the exposure to secondhand smoke, the risks of developing respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and cancer are also lowered. moreover, by discouraging the habit of smoking, the demand for tobacco products and the associated environmental and economic costs are also reduced."

(main argument or thesis statement) firstly, learning in a classroom allows students to receive more feedback from their teachers and peers, which can help them improve their understanding and skills. (left text) secondly, learning in a classroom enables students to interact more with other students, which can enhance their communication and collaboration abilities, as well as their emotional and mental well-being. (right text) thirdly, learning in a classroom can also promote students' physical health, as they can participate in exercise classes that teach them how to move their body correctly and safely. (new text) these are some of the reasons why i believe that classroom learning is more beneficial than online learning for students.",
      "Outcome2": "Learning in a classroom can also benefit students' health in ways that online classes cannot. one of the advantages of attending school is that students can participate in physical education classes, which help them to exercise their bodies and improve their fitness. physical education classes are led by specialist trainers who can teach students the correct techniques and prevent injuries. for example, a study by the centers for disease control and prevention found that students who had daily physical education classes had lower rates of obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease than those who did not. on the other hand, students who learn online may not have access to such facilities or guidance, and may be more likely to sedentary lifestyles or improper exercises. therefore, learning in a classroom can promote students' health and well-being in a way that online classes cannot.",
      "Outcome3": "However, some people might argue that learning in a classroom has some disadvantages compared to online class. for example, they might claim that classroom learning is more expensive, less flexible, and more prone to distractions or interruptions. they might also say that online class offers more options, resources, and opportunities for self-paced learning and individualized feedback. these are valid points, but they do not outweigh the benefits of classroom learning. classroom learning is more affordable in the long run, as it saves students from investing in costly devices, software, and internet access. it also gives students more structure, discipline, and motivation to complete their assignments and meet their deadlines. moreover, classroom learning fosters more social interaction, collaboration, and communication skills among students and teachers, which are essential for their personal and professional development. online class, on the other hand, can isolate students, reduce their engagement, and impair their emotional and mental well-being. therefore, classroom learning is still a better option for students who want to have a comprehensive, balanced, and healthy education.",
      "Outcome4": "Learning in a classroom has many advantages over online classes, as it can enhance students' academic performance, social skills, and physical health. students who attend school can interact with their teachers and peers, get immediate feedback, and participate in various activities that stimulate their critical thinking and creativity. they can also benefit from the exercise classes that schools offer, which can help them stay fit and prevent injuries. online classes, on the other hand, may limit students' opportunities to communicate, collaborate, and exercise, and may expose them to distractions and technical issues. therefore, students should choose classroom learning whenever possible, as it can prepare them better for their future goals and challenges.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the benefits of learning in a classroom is that students can have a healthier life. in addition to acquiring knowledge and skills from their teachers and peers, students can also participate in physical education classes that train them to move their body. classroom learning offers the advantage of having a specialist trainer who can teach students how to exercise in the right way and avoid injuries. this can help students improve their fitness and well-being, which online learning cannot provide. therefore, learning in a classroom can be more beneficial for students' physical health than learning online.",
      "Outcome6": "Learning in a classroom also has another advantage over online learning: it can promote physical well-being. while online classes may offer some flexibility and convenience, they may also limit the opportunities for students to engage in physical activity and exercise. this can have negative effects on their health, mood, and academic performance."

      "Left": "First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.",
      "Right": "Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future."

      "Prompt6": "Insert a passage connecting the two passages"
    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Not only does following celebrities blindly affect the health of adolescents, but also their behavior. many young people try to imitate the lifestyle, fashion, and attitude of their favorite stars, without considering the consequences or the reality behind the glamorous image. for instance, some adolescents may adopt risky or violent behaviors, such as driving recklessly, getting into fights, or breaking the law, because they see their idols doing so in movies or on social media. some may also develop low self-esteem, depression, or anxiety, because they compare themselves unfavorably with the unrealistic standards of beauty and success that celebrities portray. these examples show that following celebrities blindly can have a detrimental impact on the mental and emotional well-being of young individuals.",
      "Outcome2": "Not only do young people harm their health by copying the habits of celebrities, but they also adopt their negative attitudes and behaviors. for instance, some young people may imitate the violent or disrespectful actions of their idols, such as fighting, breaking the law, or cheating on their partners. similarly, some young people may follow the unrealistic or unhealthy standards of beauty or success that celebrities promote, such as undergoing cosmetic surgery, starving themselves, or using steroids. these examples show that following celebrities blindly can lead to low self-esteem, poor relationships, and ethical problems.",
      "Outcome3": "The above discussion has shown how following celebrities blindly can have detrimental effects on the health and behavior of adolescents. they may adopt unhealthy habits, such as smoking and drug use, or imitate violent and aggressive actions, such as bullying and vandalism. these effects can impair their physical and mental well-being, as well as their academic and social performance. however, there are some possible solutions that can help young people to avoid these negative influences and to develop their own identity and goals. the following paragraph will suggest some of these solutions and explain how they can benefit the young generation.",
      "Outcome4": "To prevent the negative consequences of following celebrities blindly, young people need to be educated not to fall prey to the unrealistic and harmful images and messages that are often portrayed by the media. media literacy is a skill that can help young people to critically analyze and evaluate the sources, purposes, and effects of media content, and to recognize the techniques and strategies that are used to manipulate and persuade audiences. parental guidance is also important, as parents can monitor and limit the exposure of their children to inappropriate and harmful media influences, and can also provide them with alternative and positive role models that can inspire and motivate them to pursue their own goals and interests. furthermore, young people can benefit from having mentors, teachers, or peers who can support and encourage them to develop their own identity, values, and talents, and to resist the pressure and temptation to imitate celebrities.",
      "Outcome5": "Moreover, following celebrities blindly also affects the behavior of adolescents. many young people try to copy the style, attitude, and actions of their idols, without considering the consequences or the context. for example, some young people may engage in violence, vandalism, or sexual activities, because they see their favorite celebrities doing so in movies or songs. this example shows that imitating celebrities can lead to moral degradation and social problems for young individuals.",
      "Outcome6": "Another aspect of following celebrities blindly is that it affects the behavior of adolescents. many young people try to imitate the lifestyle, attitude, and actions of their favorite stars without considering the consequences. for instance, some young people may get involved in violence, crime, or substance abuse because they see their idols doing the same. they may also lose their sense of identity, morality, and self-esteem by copying the external appearance and mannerisms of celebrities. these behaviors can have serious implications for their personal and social development."

In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.",

      "Outcome1": "The competitive atmosphere created by classmates is not only a source of pressure, but also a source of motivation for the children. by seeing their peers striving for excellence and pursuing their goals, the children are inspired to emulate their achievements and challenge themselves. they also learn from their classmates' strengths and weaknesses, and seek feedback and support from them. this way, the children develop a sense of self-efficacy and resilience, as well as a healthy attitude towards competition. they realize that they can improve their academic performances by working hard and smart, and by cooperating and competing with their classmates in a constructive manner.",
      "Outcome2": "Besides creating a competitive atmosphere, classmates can also challenge and inspire each other to achieve higher academic goals in various ways. for example, they can form study groups and share their knowledge, skills, and feedback on different subjects and assignments. they can also participate in extracurricular activities and clubs that foster their interests, talents, and passions. moreover, they can expose each other to diverse perspectives, cultures, and experiences that broaden their horizons and stimulate their curiosity. by doing so, classmates can motivate, support, and learn from each other, enhancing their academic performance and personal growth.",

For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones.

      "Outcome4": "However, learning a foreign language in one's own country is not without its limitations and drawbacks. for instance, a learner may not have enough exposure to the authentic use of the language in various contexts and situations. he may rely too much on textbooks and teachers, which may not reflect the current and dynamic nature of the language. he may also face difficulties in developing his cultural and pragmatic competence, which are essential for effective communication. therefore, some learners may prefer to learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken, as they can enjoy several advantages that are not available to those who learn the same languages in their own countries.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the advantages of learning a foreign language in its original country is the exposure to the culture and customs of the speakers. by living in the foreign country, the learner can observe how the language is used in different contexts and situations, such as formal and informal, academic and social, and written and spoken. he can also appreciate the diversity and richness of the language, as well as its history and evolution. this cultural immersion can enhance the learner's motivation and interest in the language, as well as his ability to adapt and cope with challenges. therefore, learning a foreign language in its original country can provide a more holistic and authentic learning experience than learning the same language in one's own country. on the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. he may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. no doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. he also has access to the most up-to-date language. thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'a', does not have access to.",

      "Outcome4": "However, working outside the home also poses some challenges or drawbacks for women, especially those who have children or other dependents. one of the main problems is the conflict between work and family responsibilities. women often have to juggle multiple roles and tasks, such as childcare, housework, cooking, and office work. this can lead to stress, fatigue, and reduced quality of life. moreover, some women may face discrimination, harassment, or exploitation in the workplace, which can affect their self-esteem, health, and safety. therefore, women's work is not always easy or rewarding.",

      "Outcome6": "However, working outside the home also has some disadvantages for women, especially those who have young children. one of the main drawbacks is the lack of time and energy to take care of their family and household chores. when a woman has to work long hours and commute to and from her workplace, she may not be able to spend enough quality time with her children, husband, and other relatives. she may also feel exhausted and stressed by the pressure of balancing her professional and personal responsibilities. this can affect her health, happiness, and relationships."

The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability."

      "Outcome1": "This unchanged paradigm of the old workers not only hinders their adaptation to the new technologies and methods, but also affects their productivity and performance in the workplace. evidence shows that older workers tend to have lower levels of innovation, creativity, and learning than younger workers, who are more flexible, curious, and open to new challenges. for instance, a study by the oecd found that older workers scored lower than younger workers in problem-solving skills and digital literacy, which are essential for the modern economy. moreover, older workers may also have more difficulties in collaborating with diverse and multicultural teams, as they may hold more rigid and conservative views on social and cultural issues. therefore, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm.",
      "Outcome2": "However, this perspective is not without its flaws and challenges. one might argue that old workers have valuable experience and skills that younger ones lack, and that they can contribute to the innovation and productivity of the workplace by sharing their insights and wisdom. one might also contend that old workers are not necessarily resistant to change, but rather need more support and training to adapt to new technologies and methods. moreover, one might point out that the negative and pessimistic worldview of old workers is not a universal trait, but rather a result of their specific historical and personal circumstances, and that some old workers may have a more positive and optimistic outlook than others. these arguments, however, are not convincing or relevant for several reasons. first, the experience and skills of old workers may be outdated or irrelevant in the fast-changing and competitive global market, and they may not be able to keep up with the demands and expectations of the modern workplace. second, the support and training that old workers need to change their paradigm may be costly and time-consuming, and may not guarantee their success or satisfaction in the new environment. third, the worldview of old workers may not only affect their own performance and motivation, but also create conflicts and misunderstandings with their younger colleagues and managers, who may have different values and goals. therefore, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm.",
      "Outcome3": "However, the younger generation, who grew up in a more prosperous and peaceful era, have a different outlook and attitude. they are more adaptable and innovative, willing to embrace new technologies and challenges. they are not afraid of change, but rather see it as an opportunity to learn and grow. they have a positive and optimistic mindset, which enables them to cope with the uncertainties and complexities of the modern world. for example, they are more willing to collaborate with robots and other machines, as they recognize their potential and benefits for enhancing productivity and quality.",
      "Outcome4": "In contrast, young workers have the advantages and benefits of adaptability and creativity in the modern world. they are not bound by the outdated and rigid paradigm of the old, but rather embrace the opportunities and challenges of innovation and technology. they are willing to learn new skills, collaborate with diverse teams, and experiment with different solutions. for example, they can easily operate and improve the robot that can piece together parts of a machine faster and more accurately than human hands.",
      "Outcome5": "In contrast, the younger workers are more adaptable and innovative, as they grew up in a more prosperous and dynamic era. they are familiar with the latest technologies and eager to learn new skills and methods. they can also cope better with the challenges and uncertainties of the global market and the changing customer demands. for instance, they would not hesitate to use a robot to perform a task that is tedious or risky for humans, as they trust its accuracy and reliability.",
      "Outcome6": "This mindset of the old workers not only hinders their own adaptation to the new technologies and skills, but also creates a gap with the younger ones who are more open-minded and innovative. the younger workers, on the other hand, grew up in a more prosperous and stable environment, where they were exposed to various opportunities and challenges. they are more eager to learn and apply the latest tools and methods to improve their productivity and quality."

      "Outcome5": "Therefore, it is essential to cultivate a sense of morality and justice among the citizens, especially the young generation. by educating them about the laws and regulations, the consequences of breaking them, and the values of respecting others and contributing to the society, we can foster a positive social atmosphere and prevent potential crimes. moreover, we can also encourage the participation of the public in reporting and preventing crimes, as well as supporting the victims and the law enforcement agencies. these actions can enhance the mutual trust and cooperation among the people and the authorities, and create a deterrent effect on the criminals.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is essential to cultivate the moral education and legal awareness of the public, especially the young generation. by instilling the values of honesty, respect, and responsibility, we can help them develop a sense of justice and conscience, and prevent them from being influenced by negative factors or temptations. moreover, by enhancing the legal education and enforcement, we can deter potential offenders, protect the rights and interests of the victims, and uphold the rule of law and social justice."

      "Right": "The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way."

      "Outcome1": "Communication is an essential skill in our daily lives, whether we want to share information, express opinions, or persuade others. however, not all communication methods are equally effective, and some may have advantages or disadvantages depending on the situation and the purpose. in this essay, i will argue that communicating with someone in person is the best way, especially when we want to convince or complain. i will support my claim with two main reasons and examples from my own experience and observation.",
      "Outcome2": "Communicating in person can be more convincing for several reasons. first, it can show the sincerity and seriousness of the speaker, as well as the respect and attention for the listener. by using eye contact, body language, tone of voice, and gestures, the speaker can convey their emotions and intentions more effectively than through written or verbal messages. second, it can allow the speaker and the listener to interact and respond to each other in real time, which can facilitate feedback, clarification, and negotiation. by asking questions, expressing opinions, and addressing concerns, the speaker and the listener can exchange information and perspectives more comprehensively and accurately than through delayed or limited communication channels. third, it can create a rapport and a trust between the speaker and the listener, which can enhance their understanding and cooperation. by showing empathy, appreciation, and appreciation, the speaker and the listener can establish a positive and constructive relationship that can influence their decisions and actions. therefore, communicating in person can be more convincing than other forms of communication.",
      "Outcome3": "However, some people may argue that other communication methods, such as writing, calling, or texting, have their own advantages over face-to-face communication. for instance, they may claim that these methods are more convenient and efficient, especially when the distance or time is an issue. they may also point out that these methods can allow more time for reflection and editing, which can improve the clarity and accuracy of the message. furthermore, some people may prefer these methods because they feel more comfortable or confident expressing themselves in writing or speaking than in person.",
      "Outcome4": "However, some people may argue that communicating in person is not always the best way, because it can be inconvenient, time-consuming, or risky. they may prefer to use other methods, such as emails, texts, or social media, to convey their messages quickly, easily, or anonymously. yet, these methods also have their own drawbacks, such as misunderstanding or impersonality. communicating in person can overcome these drawbacks by allowing us to use our body language, tone of voice, and eye contact to express our emotions, intentions, and sincerity. these nonverbal cues can help us to avoid confusion, clarify doubts, and build rapport with the other person. moreover, communicating in person can show our respect, care, and attention to the other person, which can enhance our relationship and trust. therefore, communicating in person is still the best way to communicate effectively and meaningfully.",
      "Outcome5": "Communicating in person can also help us to express our emotions and feelings more effectively than other methods. when we talk to someone face-to-face, we can use our body language, tone of voice, eye contact, and facial expressions to convey our message and show our sincerity, enthusiasm, or concern. these nonverbal cues can enhance our communication and make it more engaging and persuasive. for example, when we want to show our gratitude or appreciation to someone, a warm smile and a firm handshake can have a greater impact than a simple email or text message. thus, communicating with someone in person can strengthen our relationships and create a positive impression.",
      "Outcome6": "Another reason why communicating in person is the best way is that it can enhance our relationships with others. in contrast, relying on technology can sometimes create misunderstandings or conflicts."

      "Outcome1": "Advertising is the process of communicating a message, idea, or offer to a target audience through various media channels, such as television, radio, print, online, or social media. advertising is important for both businesses and consumers, as it helps businesses to promote their products or services, increase their brand awareness, and attract potential customers. consumers, on the other hand, can benefit from advertising by getting information about different options, features, prices, and quality of the products or services they need or want. however, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.",

      "Outcome3": "However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. spamming not only violates the privacy and consent of the recipients, but also wastes their time and resources, and may expose them to malicious or fraudulent content. according to a report by statista, in 2020, spam messages accounted for 45.1 percent of all email traffic worldwide, and the average cost of spam per employee per year was estimated at 1,934 us dollars. secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses. for instance, a study by nielsen found that only 10 percent of new product launches in the consumer packaged goods sector achieved breakthrough success in 2018, and that the average cost of launching a new product was 15 million us dollars. these figures suggest that advertising is a risky and costly investment that may not pay off in the long run.",
      "Outcome4": "Both views on advertising have some merits and drawbacks. on one hand, advertising can be a powerful tool to inform and persuade potential customers, create brand awareness and loyalty, and increase sales and profits. on the other hand, advertising can also be a source of nuisance and waste, as it may invade people's privacy, annoy them with unwanted messages, and cost a lot of money without guaranteeing success. in my opinion, advertising is neither inherently good nor bad, but rather depends on how it is used and regulated. i think that advertising should be ethical, respectful, and relevant to the target audience, and that businesses should evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of their advertising strategies carefully.",
      "Outcome5": "Despite these negative impacts of advertising, there are also many positive aspects that can benefit both businesses and consumers. advertising can help businesses to promote their products or services, increase their brand awareness and reputation, and attract more customers and sales. advertising can also help consumers to find out more information about the available options in the market, compare different prices and quality, and make informed decisions. advertising can also stimulate creativity, innovation, and competition among businesses, and enhance the diversity and richness of the media and culture. therefore, advertising can be seen as a valuable and essential part of the modern society.",
      "Outcome6": "Nevertheless, advertising is not only a source of disadvantages, but also a powerful tool that can benefit both businesses and consumers in various ways. advertising can help businesses to promote their products or services, increase their brand awareness, attract new customers, and compete with their rivals. advertising can also help consumers to get information about the features, prices, and quality of different products or services, compare them, and make informed choices. moreover, advertising can stimulate creativity, innovation, and diversity in the market, as well as support social causes, cultural values, and public interests. therefore, advertising is considered by many, a valuable and positive aspect of modern society."

      "Outcome2": "One way to renew some facilities in school is to equip them with modern technology and learning resources. for example, the school could install smart boards, projectors, and computers in the classrooms, so that students can access online materials, interact with multimedia, and collaborate with their peers. the school could also create more study spaces, such as libraries, lounges, and labs, where students can find books, journals, and equipment for their research and projects. these facilities would not only make the learning environment more comfortable, but also more stimulating and engaging. students would be more motivated to explore new topics, deepen their understanding, and challenge themselves.",
      "Outcome3": "The old and shabby classrooms in my school not only discourage me from staying at school to do my assignments, but also create some problems and challenges for me and my classmates. for example, some classrooms have broken chairs or desks, which make it hard to sit comfortably and write neatly. some classrooms have poor lighting or ventilation, which affect our eyesight and health. some classrooms have outdated equipment or insufficient outlets, which limit our access to online resources or electronic devices. these factors reduce our motivation and efficiency in learning, and sometimes force us to look for alternatives outside the school.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, i believe that the school should focus more on creating a conducive learning environment for students rather than on hiring prestigious professors. this would encourage students to be more active and engaged in their studies, as well as foster a healthy academic competition among them. as a student, i would appreciate having more comfortable and modern facilities in school, such as classrooms, libraries, and study areas, instead of having to resort to noisy and expensive coffee shops to do my assignments. i think this would improve the quality of my work and my satisfaction with the education i receive. therefore, i urge the school to invest more in renovating and upgrading its infrastructure to enhance the learning outcomes of its students.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, i believe that the school should invest more in renovating and upgrading the classrooms and other facilities to create a more conducive learning environment for the students. this would not only motivate the students to learn actively, but also encourage them to collaborate and communicate with their peers and professors. moreover, a modern and comfortable campus would also enhance the school's reputation and attract more talented and diverse students and faculty. by improving the physical and social aspects of the school, the education quality would also improve significantly.",
      "Outcome6": "However, focusing on students does not mean neglecting the role of professors. professors are the ones who design the curriculum, deliver the lectures, and evaluate the students' performance. therefore, the school should also invest in improving the quality and diversity of the faculty. by hiring more qualified and experienced professors, the school can offer more courses that cater to the students' interests and needs. by providing more training and feedback for the professors, the school can ensure that they use effective and innovative teaching methods. by encouraging more collaboration and communication between the professors and the students, the school can foster a more supportive and interactive learning environment."

It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.",

      "Outcome1": "Art is a form of human expression that reflects the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of the creators and the viewers. it can inspire, challenge, entertain, and educate people from different backgrounds and cultures. however, art can also have controversial or harmful effects on individuals, especially when it deals with sensitive or taboo topics. how should we deal with art that exposes us to negative aspects of reality or human nature? should we censor it, avoid it, or embrace it? the answer may depend on the age and maturity of the audience, as well as the purpose and context of the art.",
      "Outcome2": "On the other hand, art also has many positive aspects that cannot be ignored or dismissed. art can be a powerful way of expressing human emotions and experiences, such as joy, sorrow, love, anger, faith, hope, and so on. art can also inspire, educate, challenge, and entertain people, as well as enhance their creativity, imagination, and critical thinking. art can also reflect the diversity and richness of human cultures and histories, and foster mutual understanding and appreciation among people. therefore, art is not only a form of personal expression, but also a valuable social and cultural resource.",
      "Outcome3": "While art can have negative impacts on individuals, especially adolescents, who may be influenced by harmful or inappropriate messages, it can also have positive impacts on adults, who can benefit from the aesthetic, cultural, and intellectual aspects of art. art can inspire, challenge, educate, and entertain adults, who have the ability and responsibility to appreciate art critically and ethically. adults can discern the artistic intentions, contexts, and values behind the art work, and can also reflect on their own responses and opinions. rather than censoring or avoiding art that contains negative implications, adults can engage with it in a constructive and respectful way, and learn from the diverse perspectives and expressions that art offers.",
      "Outcome4": "To sum up, art is a powerful and diverse form of expression that can enrich our lives, challenge our perspectives, and inspire our creativity. however, art can also have negative effects on some people, especially adolescents who are still developing their moral and critical thinking skills. therefore, i believe that art should be appreciated and respected, but also regulated and monitored according to the age and sensitivity of the audience. my thesis statement is that art is beneficial for human development, but it also requires ethical and social responsibility.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, the question of whether art should be censored or not depends largely on the target audience and the purpose of the art. art can be a powerful tool for expressing emotions, ideas, and perspectives that may not be easily conveyed through other means. it can also inspire, educate, and challenge people to think critically and creatively. however, art can also have negative effects on some people, especially young and impressionable ones, who may be influenced by harmful or inappropriate messages. hence, it is important to have some degree of regulation and guidance on the access and exposure of art to different groups of people, while respecting the artistic freedom and integrity of the creators.",
      "Outcome6": "On the other hand, art can also have positive effects on individuals, such as stimulating their imagination, enhancing their aesthetic sense, expressing their emotions, and inspiring their creativity. art can also serve as a medium of communication, education, and social criticism, reflecting the values, beliefs, and issues of different cultures and times. therefore, art is not only a form of entertainment, but also a source of knowledge and enlightenment."

      "Outcome2": "One might argue that some people are born with natural talents or advantages that make them more likely to succeed than others. however, i believe that even those who have such gifts need to work hard to develop and utilize them. for example, mozart was a musical prodigy, but he also practiced for hours every day and composed hundreds of works. similarly, einstein was a genius, but he also studied physics and mathematics diligently and conducted many experiments and thought experiments. therefore, i think that hard work is essential for any accomplishment, and that relying on luck alone is foolish and risky.",
      "Outcome3": "Some people might argue that luck plays a significant role in some situations, such as winning a lottery, finding a rare opportunity, or meeting the right person. they might claim that hard work alone is not enough to achieve success, and that luck can make a big difference in one's life. however, this argument is flawed for several reasons. first, relying on luck is a passive and uncertain approach, while working hard is an active and consistent one. luck is unpredictable and uncontrollable, and it can change at any moment. hard work, on the other hand, is something that one can control and improve, and it can create more chances for success. second, luck is not a substitute for skill, knowledge, or effort. even if one encounters a lucky situation, one still needs to have the ability and the willingness to make the most of it. for example, winning a lottery does not guarantee happiness or security, unless one knows how to manage the money wisely. finding a rare opportunity does not mean anything, unless one has the qualifications and the confidence to seize it. meeting the right person does not ensure a lasting relationship, unless one puts in the time and the care to nurture it. third, luck is not a fair or a reliable measure of one's achievements. luck can favor or disfavor anyone, regardless of their merits or efforts. it can create unjust gaps or advantages among people, and it can undermine one's self-esteem or motivation. hard work, on the other hand, is a more accurate and rewarding indicator of one's accomplishments. hard work reflects one's character, values, and goals, and it can foster a sense of pride, satisfaction, and fulfillment.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, i believe that hard work is more important than luck for achieving success in life. depending on luck is too risky and unreliable, and it can lead to frustration and failure. on the other hand, hard work is a reliable and consistent way of pursuing one's goals and overcoming challenges. i have experienced this in my own life, as all my achievements were the result of my dedication and effort, not my luck. therefore, i agree with the statement that success is 99% hard work and 1% luck.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, i believe that hard work is more important than luck for achieving success in life. luck may play a role in some situations, but it is not something that one can rely on or control. hard work, on the other hand, is a choice that one can make and a skill that one can develop. by working hard, one can overcome challenges, learn from mistakes, and improve oneself. hard work also gives one a sense of satisfaction and confidence, knowing that one has earned the results of one's efforts. luck may or may not favor you, but hard work will always pay off.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, i believe that depending only on luck is not a wise strategy for achieving success in life. luck may or may not favor you, but hard work always pays off. by working hard, you can develop your skills, knowledge, and confidence, which are essential for overcoming challenges and reaching your potential. moreover, hard work gives you a sense of satisfaction and pride, which luck cannot provide. you can also learn from your mistakes and improve yourself, rather than blaming your fate or circumstances. hence, i agree with the statement that hard work is more important than luck."

      "Outcome3": "Besides alleviating poverty and starvation, another basic need of people is to live in a healthy and sustainable environment. however, this need is threatened by the environmental problems that affect the whole planet, such as global warming, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. these problems not only harm the natural resources and ecosystems that support human life, but also increase the risks of diseases, disasters, and conflicts. therefore, it is essential that governments cooperate and take action to protect and restore the environment. one of the ways to do this is to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and switch to cleaner and renewable sources of energy, such as solar power. by doing so, governments can also create new opportunities for economic development and social justice. hence, environment is a vital issue that deserves the attention and investment of governments. second, environment is also an important issue that everyone depends on it. nowadays, industries in many countries still emit high amounts of carbon dioxide, which causes the greenhouse effect. greenhouse effect causes climate change. these impact every living creature in the world. so, governments should take care of this issue by declaring regulations to control the emission of carbon dioxide. in addition to controlling carbon dioxide emissions, governments should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. if we lived in a good environment, our life would be better.",

But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.",
      "Right": "Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The media coverage of celebrities is a worrying trend because it can influence children's values and aspirations in a negative way. for example, a study by the university of leicester found that young people who were exposed to more celebrity news were more likely to have lower self-esteem, higher materialism, and lower academic motivation than those who were less exposed. another research by the university of sussex revealed that children who idolized celebrities were more prone to anxiety, depression, and eating disorders than those who had more realistic and diverse role models. these findings suggest that the media's obsession with celebrities can distort children's perception of reality and themselves, and undermine their well-being and development.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the negative impacts of media coverage of celebrities is that it creates unrealistic expectations and pressures for children who admire them. children may think that they have to look like, act like, or have the same lifestyle as their favourite stars, regardless of the costs or consequences. they may also lose sight of their own values, goals, and identities, as they try to emulate or impress someone who may not even be worthy of their respect.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the reasons why the media's excessive coverage of celebrities is a worrying trend is that some celebrities are not good role models for children. their actions can influence children's values and behaviours in negative ways. for example, when children see their favourite stars indulging in drugs or alcohols, they may think that this is acceptable or glamorous, and may be tempted to try them themselves. similarly, when children witness their idols having messy sex lives or cheating on their partners, they may lose respect for the importance of loyalty and commitment, and may develop unrealistic or unhealthy expectations of relationships. these examples show that some celebrities can have a harmful impact on children's moral development and well-being.",
      "Outcome4": "The media's obsession with celebrities can create a distorted image of reality for children, who may admire and imitate the stars they see on the screen or in the magazines. however, not all celebrities are role models. it is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living. this can have negative effects on their moral values, self-esteem, and aspirations. therefore, it is important for parents or society to help children develop a critical view of media and celebrities, and to encourage them to seek more meaningful and realistic sources of inspiration and guidance.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the reasons why the media's obsession with celebrities is harmful for children is that it creates unrealistic and distorted expectations of success and happiness. children who idolize celebrities may think that fame and fortune are the ultimate goals in life, and that they can achieve them without hard work, education, or moral values. they may also envy the celebrities' lavish lifestyles and feel dissatisfied with their own circumstances.",
      "Outcome6": "One reason why this trend is worrying is that the media coverage of celebrities can create unrealistic expectations and distorted values for children. children who idolize celebrities may think that their success and happiness depend on their appearance, fame, wealth, or popularity. they may also neglect their own talents, interests, and goals, and focus on imitating or following the celebrities they admire. moreover, they may be exposed to harmful or inappropriate messages and influences from the media."

This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper.

      "Outcome2": "Living in an apartment gives you more independence and privacy than living in a dormitory. you can have your own space, where you can study, relax, or do whatever you want without being disturbed by roommates or dorm rules. you can also set your own rules, such as when to sleep, when to clean, and how to decorate your room. moreover, you can invite guests, such as friends, family, or partners, without worrying about sharing the space or getting permission from others. these benefits can enhance your personal and social development, as well as your academic performance.",
      "Outcome3": "Another reason why living in an apartment is better than living in a dormitory is that it can offer more economic benefits in the long run. while an apartment may have a higher initial cost, it can also provide more opportunities to save money or generate income. for example, living in an apartment can allow you to cook your own meals, which can be healthier and cheaper than eating out or relying on campus food. you can also use the apartment as a place to study, work, or entertain guests, which can reduce the need for spending money on other facilities or activities. additionally, you can take advantage of the extra rooms in the apartment to rent them out to other students or travelers, which can help you cover part of the rent or even make a profit. therefore, living in an apartment can be a smart investment that can enhance your financial situation and independence.",
      "Outcome4": "Living in an apartment also gives you more opportunities to socialize and make friends with different people, which can enrich your college experience and help you develop interpersonal skills. for example, you could rent the extra rooms in your apartment to other students who share your interests or majors, and create a supportive and fun community. you could also invite guests over for parties, study sessions, or movie nights, and enjoy the privacy and comfort of your own space. moreover, living in an apartment allows you to choose the best way to commute to and from the university, depending on your budget and preferences. you could use public transportation, which is cheaper and more eco-friendly, and also gives you a chance to explore the city and its attractions. or you could have a car, which is more expensive and requires maintenance, but also gives you more freedom and flexibility to travel to other places, such as nearby towns, parks, or beaches.",
      "Outcome5": "However, living in an apartment also has some drawbacks that should not be overlooked. for instance, you might have to deal with noisy or unreliable roommates, maintenance issues, or conflicts with the landlord. moreover, living in an apartment might make you feel isolated from the campus life and the opportunities to socialize and participate in extracurricular activities. therefore, before making a decision, you should weigh the pros and cons of both options carefully. to conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally i think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.",
      "Outcome6": "However, living in an apartment also has some drawbacks that should not be ignored. for example, you have to deal with the responsibilities of maintaining the apartment, such as paying the bills, cleaning, and fixing any problems that may arise. you also have to get along with your roommates, who may have different habits, preferences, and personalities than you. moreover, living in an apartment may make you feel more isolated from the campus life and the social opportunities that a dormitory can offer. you may miss out on some of the events, activities, and friendships that are part of the college experience."

      "Outcome2": "One reason why movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners is that they often use slang, idioms, and colloquial expressions that are difficult to understand for non-native speakers. for example, a beginner who watches a comedy movie might not catch the jokes or the sarcasm that the actors use, and might miss the cultural references and the nuances of the dialogue. moreover, movies usually do not have subtitles or captions that can help the learners follow the speech and check the spelling and pronunciation of the words. on the contrary, novels provide more context and explanation for the language they use, and allow the learners to read at their own pace and look up unfamiliar words in a dictionary. novels also expose the learners to a variety of genres, styles, and themes that can enrich their vocabulary and grammar. therefore, novels are more comprehensible and enjoyable for beginners than movies.",
      "Outcome3": "Moreover, reading novels can also help language learners to improve their vocabulary, grammar, and cultural awareness. unlike movies, which often use slang, idioms, and colloquial expressions that might confuse beginners, novels tend to use more standard and formal language that can be easily understood and applied. in addition, novels can expose language learners to different genres, styles, and perspectives that can enrich their knowledge and appreciation of the target culture. for example, reading a historical novel can help learners to learn about the historical events, customs, and values of a certain period, while reading a fantasy novel can help learners to expand their imagination and creativity. therefore, reading novels can be a more effective and enjoyable way to learn a language than watching movies.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, watching tv can be a fun and educational activity for some people, but it is not an effective way to learn a language for beginners. movies often use slang, idioms, and colloquial expressions that can confuse and frustrate language learners who need to master the basic grammar and vocabulary first. reading novels, on the other hand, can provide a more accessible and enjoyable source of language input, as they allow learners to control the pace, check the meaning, and immerse themselves in the story. therefore, beginners should choose novels over movies if they want to improve their language skills and have a pleasant learning experience.",
      "Outcome5": "Nevertheless, watching tv is not the only way to learn something new and interesting. some people might prefer to read books instead of watching movies, especially if they want to learn a language. this point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. for these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable. reading novels can help them to improve their vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, as well as to immerse themselves in the culture and context of the language. moreover, reading novels can also stimulate their imagination and creativity, which are important skills for communication and expression. therefore, reading novels can be a more effective and enjoyable way to learn a language than watching movies.",
      "Outcome6": "However, learning a language by watching movies is not the only way to gain knowledge from tv. there are many other types of programs that can educate and inform viewers about various topics such as history, science, culture, and current affairs. these programs can provide valuable information and insights that can broaden one's horizons and stimulate one's curiosity. moreover, these programs often use clear and standard language that can help language learners improve their listening and comprehension skills. therefore, watching educational tv programs can be a beneficial and enjoyable activity for people who want to learn new things."

      "Outcome2": "One of the benefits of attending school in person is the opportunity to interact with professors who can guide, advise, and support students in their academic journey. professors can provide immediate feedback, clarify doubts, and offer encouragement to students who face challenges or difficulties. however, distance learning changes the role and importance of the professor in the educational process. instead of being mentors and facilitators, professors may become more like instructors who deliver content and assess performance. additionally, distance learning may limit the communication and rapport between professors and students, as there may be delays, technical issues, or lack of personal contact. therefore, distance learning may reduce the quality and quantity of the professor-student relationship, which can affect the learning outcomes and satisfaction of both parties.",
      "Outcome3": "However, despite the benefits of distance learning, some students may miss the personal interaction and support that they receive from their professors in school.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, traditional school and distance learning have many differences that affect the quality of education and the interaction between students and teachers. traditional school offers more opportunities for students to socialize, collaborate, and receive feedback from their peers and teachers. distance learning, on the other hand, limits the communication and support that students can get from their instructors and classmates. therefore, traditional school is more beneficial for students who want to develop their academic and social skills, while distance learning may be more suitable for students who prefer more flexibility and independence.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, school learning has many benefits over distance learning in terms of social interaction and support. when students learn in school, they can communicate with their classmates and friends, share their ideas and opinions, and develop their social skills. they can also receive guidance and help from their professors, who are available and attentive to their needs and problems. however, when students learn from a distance, they lose these opportunities and advantages. they may feel isolated and lonely, and they may have difficulties in expressing themselves and understanding the materials. they may also face delays and challenges in getting feedback and assistance from their professors, who have limited roles and responsibilities in distance learning.",
      "Outcome6": "These are some of the benefits of having face-to-face interactions with classmates and professors in school, which can enhance the learning experience and foster a sense of belonging and support. however, in distance learning, these benefits are diminished or lost due to the lack of physical presence and direct communication. in the next paragraph, we will examine how distance learning affects the role of the professor and the quality of feedback and guidance that students receive."

It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors."

      "Outcome2": "Therefore, it is not fair to hold advertising solely responsible for the unhealthy eating habits of people. advertising is only one of the many factors that influence people's choices of foods, and it does not force anyone to buy or consume them. people have the responsibility to educate themselves about the nutritional value and health risks of different foods, and to make rational and informed decisions based on their own needs and preferences. moreover, people have the ability to resist the allure of advertising by exercising self-discipline and moderation, and by following a balanced and varied diet. advertising may be persuasive, but it is not coercive or determinative.",
      "Outcome3": "In conclusion, advertising is not the sole factor that influences personal eating habit. people have the responsibility and the ability to make informed and rational choices about what they eat, based on their knowledge and self-discipline. advertising is only one of the many sources of information that people can access and evaluate critically. therefore, people should not use advertising as an excuse for their unhealthy eating patterns, but rather take action to improve their diets and lifestyles.",
      "Outcome4": "Therefore, it is not reasonable to hold advertising solely responsible for the unhealthy eating habits of people. although advertising can influence people's choices and preferences, it cannot force them to consume certain foods or ignore the consequences of their diets. people have the autonomy and responsibility to make informed and balanced decisions about their food intake, based on various sources of information and their own goals and values. instead of blaming advertising, people should focus on educating themselves and others about the benefits of nutritious and diverse foods, and finding ways to enjoy them in moderation and with pleasure. this would be a more effective and positive way to promote a healthy eating culture and prevent the problems of obesity and malnutrition.",
      "Outcome5": "Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that advertising does have a significant impact on people's food choices, especially on children and adolescents. they are more susceptible to the influence of advertising because they have less knowledge and experience about nutrition and health. they are also more likely to be attracted by the colorful images, catchy slogans, and appealing endorsements of celebrities or cartoon characters. advertising can create a false impression that fast food or junk food is delicious, convenient, and fun, while ignoring or downplaying the potential risks of obesity, diabetes, or heart disease. therefore, it is essential that parents, educators, and health authorities take some measures to counteract the negative effects of advertising on young people's eating habits. for example, they can provide more education and guidance on balanced diets, limit the exposure and access to unhealthy food advertisements, and encourage more physical activities and hobbies.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, advertising is not the only factor that influences personal eating habit, nor is it an excuse for people to indulge in unhealthy foods. however, this does not mean that advertising has no responsibility or impact at all. on the contrary, advertising can be a powerful tool to shape public perception and preference, especially when it comes to children and adolescents who are more susceptible to persuasive messages and peer pressure."

      "Outcome1": "Another argument against capital punishment is that it does not deter crime, but rather increases the likelihood of more violence and injustice. according to some studies, there is no evidence that the death penalty has any effect on reducing the rate of homicide or other serious crimes. on the contrary, some researchers suggest that the death penalty may actually provoke more violence by creating a cycle of brutality and vengeance. furthermore, the death penalty may also lead to wrongful convictions and executions of innocent people, due to human errors, biases, or corruption in the criminal justice system. therefore, capital punishment is not only a form of revenge, but also a risky and ineffective way of dealing with crime.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the disadvantages of capital punishment is that it is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. as a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the \"legalized revenge\" to victims' family. hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture. another drawback of this harsh measure is that it may not be an effective deterrent or a just punishment for some serious criminals. for them, capital punishment may be an easy way out. criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. if they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. they do not undergo any pain or misery. why do not we have other wisely punishments? as we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. therefore, instead of resorting to the irreversible and inhumane practice of capital punishment, we should consider more humane and constructive alternatives that can protect the society and reform the offenders.",
      "Outcome3": "Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates a violent culture. crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. as a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the \"legalized revenge\" to victims' family. hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture. moreover, it sends a message that killing is acceptable and justified in some cases, which may encourage more violence and brutality among the public. it also undermines the respect for human dignity and the value of life, which are essential for a peaceful and civilized society. therefore, capital punishment is not only ineffective but also harmful for the social and moral development of the nation.",
      "Outcome4": "Another disadvantage of capital punishment is that it is an easy way out for some serious criminals who should be held accountable for their crimes. by ending their lives quickly and painlessly, they avoid facing the consequences of their actions and the suffering they caused to their victims and their families. instead of giving them a cheap escape, the justice system should impose alternative punishments that would make them contribute to the society they harmed or learn from their mistakes. for example, they could be sentenced to hard labor in industries that need manpower, such as mining, oil and gas extraction, or reclamation. this would not only serve as a deterrent and a restitution, but also as a way to develop their skills and values. alternatively, they could be offered rehabilitation and education programs that would help them reform and reintegrate into the community. these options would be more humane and effective than capital punishment, which neither controls the violence in society nor creates a violent culture.",
      "Outcome5": "Another argument against capital punishment is that it does not deter crime or reduce violence. there is no conclusive evidence that the death penalty has any effect on the crime rate or the number of homicides. on the contrary, some studies suggest that the death penalty may actually increase the level of violence in society by legitimizing the use of lethal force and by brutalizing the public. moreover, the death penalty does not address the root causes of crime, such as poverty, inequality, social injustice, or mental illness. therefore, capital punishment is not only a form of revenge, but also a futile and ineffective measure.",
      "Outcome6": "However, some people may argue that capital punishment is a deterrent for potential criminals and a way of delivering justice to the victims and their families. they may claim that the death penalty is the only suitable response to the most heinous crimes and that it shows respect for the sanctity of human life by removing those who violate it. they may also point out that the death penalty is a cheaper and more efficient alternative to keeping dangerous criminals in prison for life."

      "Outcome1": "Growing up in a big city can have different impacts on children's lives, depending on their environment, interests and opportunities. some people may assume that urban children are isolated, bored and addicted to technology, but this is not always the case. in fact, some children who live in big cities enjoy a variety of outdoor activities, social interactions and cultural experiences with their friends and neighbors. for example, the left text describes how the author and their friends used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day in their neighborhood. they did play video-games, but that wasn't their main activity. in contrast, the right text shows how living in a big city can expose children to more kinds of people and more things to do, such as visiting museums, parks, theaters and festivals. these activities can enrich their knowledge, creativity and curiosity. therefore, growing up in a big city can be a positive and fun experience for children, as long as they have a balance between indoor and outdoor activities, and a supportive and diverse community.",
      "Outcome2": "Some people have a negative view of big cities and think that they are not good places for children to grow up. they may believe that big cities are too crowded, noisy, polluted, dangerous, or boring, and that children have no access to nature or outdoor activities. however, these are stereotypes or misinformation that do not reflect the reality of many big city dwellers. as the left text shows, a child who lives in a big city can have a rich and diverse social life, enjoy different kinds of sports and hobbies, and explore their surroundings. a big city can offer more opportunities, experiences, and cultures than a small town or a rural area. the right text illustrates some of the benefits of living in a big city for a child.",
      "Outcome3": "Growing up in a big city was a fun and enriching experience for me, as i had many opportunities to play, learn and socialize with my friends in my neighborhood. i think it was different from living in a small town or a rural area, where there might be less diversity, less facilities and less entertainment options. however, i also recognize that there are some advantages and disadvantages to each scenario, and that everyone's childhood is shaped by their family, culture and personality. for example, some people might prefer the quietness, the nature and the sense of community that a small town or a rural area can offer, while others might feel bored, isolated or limited by the lack of resources, activities and choices. similarly, some people might enjoy the excitement, the variety and the opportunities that a big city can provide, while others might feel stressed, alienated or overwhelmed by the noise, the pollution and the competition. therefore, i think that the best place to grow up depends on what suits each person's needs, interests and goals.",
      "Outcome4": "Growing up in a big city can be a positive and enriching experience for children, as i have shown in my essay. contrary to some stereotypes, living in a large urban area does not mean that children are isolated or addicted to technology. they can have fun and healthy activities with their friends, such as playing sports, biking, or climbing trees. they can also learn from the diversity and the opportunities that a big city offers. therefore, i believe that children who grow up in a big city can develop into well-rounded and adaptable individuals.",
      "Outcome5": "Living in a big city does not mean that you have to spend all your time indoors, as some people might assume. there are many advantages and opportunities that a city can offer to a child, such as diversity, culture, and entertainment. the left text illustrates how a child can have a fun and active lifestyle in a city, by playing with friends, exploring nature, and enjoying different hobbies. the right text supports this idea by pointing out that a city has more kinds of people and more things to do than a rural or suburban area. therefore, growing up in a big city can be a rewarding and enriching experience for a child, as long as they have a good balance between indoor and outdoor activities.",
      "Outcome6": "Growing up in a big city can have many advantages and disadvantages, depending on the environment and the opportunities that one has. some people may have a negative stereotype of city life, thinking that it is boring, isolating, or dangerous for children. however, this is not always the case, as my own experience shows."

      "Outcome3": "However, freedom is not the only factor that young adults should consider when deciding whether to live on their own or with their parents. freedom also comes with responsibility and accountability, which are essential skills for adulthood. living on your own may seem appealing, but it also exposes you to many risks and challenges that can affect your well-being and future goals. therefore, i believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.",

      "Left": "To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.",
      "Right": "At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Improving the education quality at school is a crucial issue that affects the academic performance and future prospects of students. however, there are different opinions on how to allocate the limited resources available for this purpose. some people may argue that increasing professors' salary is a way to motivate them to teach better and attract more qualified faculty. however, i disagree with this view and believe that the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. in this essay, i will explain why i think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively and provide them with a comfortable and stimulating environment.",
      "Outcome2": "Increasing professors' salary is not an effective way to improve the education quality because it does not address the needs and interests of the students. professors are already paid well enough to perform their duties of teaching and researching, and giving them more money does not necessarily motivate them to improve their pedagogy or curriculum. moreover, increasing professors' salary may create a gap between the faculty and the students, as the former may feel more entitled and less accountable to the latter. additionally, increasing professors' salary may reduce the funds available for other aspects of the school, such as facilities, equipment, libraries, scholarships, and extracurricular activities, which are essential for enhancing the students' learning experience and outcomes. therefore, instead of focusing on professors, the school should put more emphasis on students, as the left text suggests.",
      "Outcome3": "However, increasing professors' salary is not the best way to improve the education quality at school. although professors are important for teaching and mentoring students, they are not the only factor that affects students' learning outcomes. in fact, giving more money to professors may have some negative consequences, such as reducing the budget for other educational resources, creating dissatisfaction among other staff, or attracting professors who are more interested in money than in teaching. therefore, i think the school should allocate its funds more wisely and focus on the needs of students. one of the most urgent needs is to renew some facilities at school that can enhance students' learning experience and motivation.",
      "Outcome4": "Renewing some facilities at school can enhance students' learning outcomes and motivation in various ways. for example, upgrading the library with more books, computers, and study spaces can provide students with more resources and opportunities to conduct research, access information, and collaborate with peers. according to a study by barrett et al. (2015), the quality of the physical learning environment has a significant impact on students' academic performance and well-being. another example is improving the laboratory equipment and technology to enable students to conduct more experiments, simulations, and demonstrations that can deepen their understanding of scientific concepts and principles. a report by the national research council (2006) states that laboratory experiences can help students develop scientific reasoning, inquiry skills, and interest in science. therefore, by renewing some facilities at school, students can learn actively and effectively, which is more beneficial than increasing the professors' salaries.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, i believe that the school should invest more in improving the facilities and the environment for the students, rather than increasing the salaries of the professors. the professors already have enough incentives and resources to conduct their research and teach their courses. however, the students need more support and encouragement to learn actively and creatively. if the school can provide them with modern and comfortable classrooms, libraries, labs, and other spaces, they will be more motivated and engaged in their studies. they will also have more opportunities to interact and collaborate with their peers and professors, which will enhance their academic performance and skills. this will benefit not only the students, but also the school's reputation and quality of education.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, i believe that the school should allocate more resources to improve the learning environment for students, rather than increasing the salaries of professors. professors are already well-paid and respected in their fields, and they should focus on teaching and inspiring students, not demanding more money. on the other hand, students need more support and motivation to engage in active learning and enhance their academic performance."

      "Outcome2": "Technology, while bringing convenience and efficiency to many aspects of modern society, can also have negative impacts on healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. for example, technology can encourage people to spend more time on screens and devices, reducing their physical activity and increasing their risk of chronic diseases. technology can also consume a lot of fossil fuels and generate waste and pollution, harming the natural environment and contributing to global warming. technology can also weaken the connection and transmission of traditional culture and values, as people may lose interest or access to the skills and lifestyles of their ancestors. therefore, traditional ways of life can complement modern life by offering alternative and beneficial solutions to these challenges. traditional skills and lifestyles can promote a healthier and more balanced lifestyle, as they involve more manual work, outdoor activities and natural remedies. they can also protect the environment by using renewable and organic resources, minimizing waste and respecting nature. they can also preserve and enrich the cultural inherit of different communities, as they reflect the wisdom, creativity and diversity of human history. by integrating traditional and modern elements, society can achieve a more harmonious and sustainable development.",
      "Outcome3": "However, some people may argue that traditional skills and lifestyles are outdated and irrelevant in the face of rapid technological development and global challenges. they may claim that modern society needs more innovation, efficiency and competitiveness, and that traditional ways of life are inefficient, backward and incompatible with the demands of the contemporary world. they may also question the validity and reliability of traditional knowledge and practices, and suggest that they are based on superstition, prejudice and ignorance. in the following paragraph, i will examine these counter-arguments and explain why they are not convincing.",
      "Outcome4": "However, some people may argue that traditional skills and lifestyles are outdated and irrelevant in modern society. they may claim that technology has improved the quality and efficiency of life, and that traditional practices are inefficient, impractical and backward. they may also contend that traditional cultures and values are incompatible with the demands and challenges of the contemporary world, and that people should adapt to the changes and embrace innovation and diversity.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, traditional skills and lifestyles should not be neglected or abandoned in the face of rapid technological development. rather, they should be valued and preserved as valuable resources that can enhance the quality of life, the sustainability of the environment and the diversity of the culture in modern society. by learning from and practicing traditional skills and lifestyles, people can benefit from the wisdom and experience of their ancestors, as well as enrich their own identity and creativity. moreover, traditional skills and lifestyles can foster a sense of connection and cooperation among people, as well as respect and appreciation for nature and heritage. in this way, traditional skills and lifestyles can play an important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is essential to preserve and promote traditional skills and lifestyles in modern society, as they offer many benefits for human well-being, environmental sustainability and cultural diversity. however, this does not mean that modern society should abandon or reject technology and innovation, which also have their own advantages and challenges. rather, it means that modern society should seek a balance and integration between tradition and modernity, and learn from both the wisdom and the mistakes of the past and the present."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Vegetarian diet and religion are closely related for many people who choose to abstain from animal products for ethical or spiritual reasons. while some may argue that vegetarianism is a personal choice or a health benefit, others may base their decision on their faith and beliefs. for example, some religions, such as buddhism, teach that animals are reincarnated beings who deserve compassion and respect, and that eating their flesh is a form of violence and ignorance. in this essay, i will explore how religious beliefs influence vegetarian diet and how this can affect the individual and the society.",
      "Outcome2": "Vegetarianism is not only a dietary choice, but also a way of expressing one's ethical and spiritual values. many religions around the world have advocated for abstaining from meat consumption, either partially or completely, as a means of showing compassion, nonviolence, and respect for all living beings. for instance, buddhism, which originated in india and spread to many asian countries, teaches that all sentient beings have the potential to attain nirvana, the state of liberation from suffering and ignorance. therefore, buddhists avoid killing or harming animals, and many of them follow a vegetarian diet. some religion, such as buddha, believes that animals were human beings in their previous life, so eating their meat means you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. it is often said that this view is rather unscientific. however, i am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind. similarly, hinduism, the oldest and most diverse religion in india, also promotes vegetarianism as a way of honoring the principle of ahimsa, or non-injury, to all creatures. hindu scriptures classify foods into three categories: sattvic, rajasic, and tamasic, based on their effects on the body and mind. sattvic foods, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products, are considered pure, wholesome, and conducive to mental clarity and peace. rajasic foods, such as spicy, sour, bitter, and salty foods, are stimulating, energizing, and passionate, but also cause agitation and restlessness. tamasic foods, such as meat, fish, eggs, garlic, onion, and alcohol, are dull, inert, and ignorant, and induce laziness, ignorance, and attachment. therefore, hindus who seek to cultivate sattvic qualities and attain spiritual realization prefer to eat vegetarian foods. jainism, another ancient religion that originated in india, is perhaps the most strict and rigorous in its adherence to vegetarianism. jains believe that every living being, from plants to animals to humans, has a soul that can be liberated from the cycle of birth and death. they practice an extreme form of nonviolence, called ahimsa, which forbids them from harming or killing any living being, even unintentionally. they also avoid eating root vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, and onions, because they believe that uprooting them causes harm to many microorganisms that live in the soil. jains also observe fasting, charity, and meditation as part of their spiritual discipline.",
      "Outcome3": "However, not everyone agrees that religious beliefs are a valid reason to adopt a vegetarian diet. some critics might argue that such beliefs are based on superstition or dogma, and that they ignore the nutritional and ecological benefits of eating meat. they might point out that humans are omnivorous by nature, and that meat provides essential protein, iron, and vitamin b12 that are hard to obtain from plant sources. they might also claim that vegetarianism can have negative impacts on the environment, such as increasing the demand for water, land, and fertilizers for crops, or reducing the biodiversity and ecosystem services of grazing animals.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, a vegetarian diet can be motivated by various factors, such as health benefits, environmental concerns, and religious beliefs. people who choose to abstain from animal products may have different reasons for doing so, but they all share a common goal of living a more compassionate and ethical lifestyle. i have argued that a vegetarian diet is not only beneficial for individuals, but also for the planet and the animals. therefore, i urge you to consider adopting a vegetarian diet, or at least reducing your meat consumption, as a way of improving your well-being and contributing to a more sustainable and humane world. alternatively, you can also explore more about the diverse perspectives and practices of vegetarians from different cultures and traditions, and learn from their wisdom and experience.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, ethical and religious reasons are two of the most common factors that motivate people to adopt a vegetarian diet. however, there are also other benefits that can be derived from avoiding animal products, such as health and environmental advantages. in the following paragraphs, i will discuss how a vegetarian diet can improve one's physical well-being and reduce the negative impact on the planet.",
      "Outcome6": "In addition to the health and environmental benefits, another reason why some people choose a vegetarian diet is their religious beliefs. different faiths have different teachings and rules regarding the consumption of animal products, and some followers may adhere to them strictly or partially. for instance, one of the most common religions that promotes vegetarianism is buddhism, which has a specific view on the nature of animals and their relationship to humans."

      "Outcome2": "The nature of parantage refers to the way that parents interact with their children and influence their personality, values, and behavior. by having an equal role in the family, both the mother and the father can provide different but complementary aspects of parantage that benefit the child's growth and well-being. this supports my thesis statement that the father's role should be equal to the mother's role because it shows that both parents have something valuable to offer to their children and that they can balance each other's strengths and weaknesses.",
      "Outcome3": "However, some might argue that having an equal father's role is not feasible or desirable for every family, depending on their cultural, social, or personal circumstances. for instance, some fathers may face difficulties in balancing their work and family responsibilities, especially in contexts where they are expected to be the primary breadwinners or providers. some mothers may prefer to have more autonomy or authority in making decisions for the child's welfare or education, especially if they have more expertise or experience in these areas. some children may also have different preferences or needs for the type and amount of involvement from their fathers, depending on their age, gender, or personality. therefore, it is important to consider the diversity and complexity of family situations and dynamics when advocating for an equal father's role.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, i have argued that the father's role should be equal to the mother's role in the family, based on the nature of parantage, the benefits of shared responsibilities, and the diversity of perspectives. i believe that both parents have valuable contributions to make to the child's upbringing, and that they can complement each other's strengths and weaknesses. by adopting a more balanced and flexible approach to parenting, families can foster a healthier and happier environment for their children. therefore, the father's role should not be underestimated or marginalized, but rather recognized and respected as an essential part of the family.",
      "Outcome5": "However, the nature of parantage does not always translate into equal roles for the father and the mother in the family. the right text illustrates how a traditional turkish family assigns different roles to the parents, based on their gender and cultural norms. in this case, the father's role is more authoritarian and conversative, while the mother's role is more sincere and thoughtful. this contrast may create a gap between the child's expectations and experiences of the father's role, as well as limit the father's involvement and influence in the child's development.",
      "Outcome6": "However, this stereotypical division of parental roles may not reflect the reality of modern families or the needs of the child. the father's role should be equal to the mother's role because of the nature of parantage."

      "Left": "Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.",

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The main argument of this essay is that the exposure of children and teenagers to violent content in tv shows and movies has a negative impact on their behavior and morality, and that governments should take measures to prevent this. to support this claim, the essay has discussed the effects of violent media on the psychological development of young people, the correlation between violent tv and crime rates, and the need for a legal framework to regulate the content of children's television programs. in the following paragraph, the essay will summarize its position and provide some recommendations for the future.",
      "Outcome2": "There is ample evidence to suggest that violent tv shows have a detrimental effect on children's behavior and psychology. according to a meta-analysis of 217 studies, exposure to media violence increases the likelihood of aggressive and antisocial behavior, desensitization to violence, and fear of being victimized (anderson et al., 2003). moreover, a longitudinal study of 329 children found that watching violent tv shows at age 8 predicted criminal behavior and antisocial personality disorder at age 30 (johnson et al., 2002). these findings indicate that violent tv shows can impair children's moral development and social adjustment, and increase their risk of becoming offenders or victims of crime.",
      "Outcome3": "Banning violent content in children's programs can help prevent juvenile delinquency and promote social harmony in several ways. first, it can protect the young viewers from being exposed to harmful images and messages that may influence their attitudes, behaviors, and values. second, it can foster a positive and peaceful culture among the children, who can learn to respect others, resolve conflicts peacefully, and cooperate with their peers. third, it can reduce the risk of developing psychological problems, such as aggression, anxiety, or depression, that may result from witnessing or experiencing violence. by eliminating the negative impact of violent content on children's development, governments can create a safer and more harmonious society for the future generations.",
      "Outcome4": "To sum up, the middle paragraph argues that banning violent content from children's television programs is a necessary and effective measure to lower the crime rate, as young viewers are more likely to be influenced by such content and develop aggressive and criminal behaviors. therefore, the author believes that governments should enact a strict law to protect juveniles from harmful media exposure. in conclusion, the author reiterates his or her opinion and adds a contrasting point.",
      "Outcome5": "This policy of banning violent content from children's television programs would not only benefit the young viewers, but also the society as a whole. by limiting the exposure of minors to harmful and disturbing images, governments can foster a more peaceful and harmonious environment for everyone. moreover, by respecting the rights and preferences of adults, governments can avoid infringing on their freedom of expression and choice. adults, in turn, can exercise their responsibility and discretion when watching tv shows and movies that contain violent scenes. they can also educate and guide their children to develop critical thinking and moral values. in conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.",
      "Outcome6": "This policy of banning violent content from children's television programs would not only protect the young viewers from harmful influences, but also respect the rights and preferences of adult audiences. unlike children, most adults are able to discern between reality and fiction, and to enjoy violent tv shows and movies as a form of entertainment, without being influenced by their negative messages. moreover, adults have the freedom and responsibility to choose what they want to watch, and to exercise their critical thinking and moral judgment. therefore, while restricting the exposure of violent content to children is a reasonable and effective measure to prevent crime, imposing the same restriction on adults would be unjustified and unnecessary."

      "Outcome2": "Advertising plays an important role economically by stimulating the demand and supply of goods and services in the market. by informing consumers about the features, benefits, and prices of different products, advertisements encourage them to make purchases that suit their needs and preferences. this in turn increases the sales and profits of the producers, who can invest more in innovation, quality, and efficiency. for example, a study by the advertising association in the uk found that every pound spent on advertising generates six pounds of economic output and supports 550,000 jobs. moreover, advertising also fosters competition among businesses, who have to differentiate themselves from their rivals and offer better value to customers. this can lead to lower prices, higher quality, and more variety for consumers. for instance, a report by the federal trade commission in the us showed that advertising reduces the average price of prescription drugs by 4.6% and increases the number of new drugs entering the market by 12%.",
      "Outcome3": "However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. they introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective. nevertheless, some people may argue that advertising has more negative than positive effects on society, such as promoting consumerism, manipulating emotions, and invading privacy. in the following paragraph, we will examine these claims and show why they are not convincing.",
      "Outcome4": "However, despite the fact that advertisements can be beneficial for the economy, they also have negative effects on consumers and society. advertising can influence people's preferences, values, and lifestyles, sometimes in harmful ways. for example, advertising can create unrealistic expectations and dissatisfaction with one's own appearance, leading to low self-esteem and eating disorders. advertising can also promote consumerism and materialism, encouraging people to buy things they do not need or cannot afford, and creating waste and debt. furthermore, advertising can manipulate people's emotions and opinions, using techniques such as fear, guilt, or patriotism, to persuade them to support certain causes or products. these effects can undermine people's autonomy, critical thinking, and social responsibility.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, while it is necessary to be aware of the potential drawbacks of advertising, such as misleading or exaggerated claims, one should not overlook its positive effects on the economy and society. advertising can be a source of information, entertainment, and diversity for consumers, as well as a means of promoting fair and efficient markets for producers. by informing and attracting customers, advertising can stimulate demand, innovation, and competition, which can benefit both the sellers and the buyers of goods and services.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, advertising can be seen as a double-edged sword, with both positive and negative impacts on consumers and society. on one hand, it can mislead, manipulate, and exploit people's emotions and needs, creating unrealistic expectations and dissatisfaction. on the other hand, it can also inform, educate, and entertain people, offering them variety and value in the market."

      "Outcome1": "The impact of cheap air fares on the environment and society has been a controversial topic in recent years. some people believe that low-cost flights have many advantages for individuals and countries, while others argue that they have serious negative consequences. it is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. these days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. they can develop their careers, broaden their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries. however, in this essay, i will examine the drawbacks of cheap air fares and explain why they are more significant than the benefits. in conclusion, i would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. however, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.",
      "Outcome2": "However, cheap air fares also have negative impacts on the environment, which cannot be ignored. air travel is one of the major sources of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to global warming and climate change. according to the international civil aviation organization, the global aviation sector accounted for 2.4% of the total co2 emissions in 2018, and this figure is projected to increase in the future. climate change poses serious threats to the natural ecosystems, biodiversity, human health, and food security of many regions. therefore, the environmental costs of cheap air fares may outweigh the social and economic benefits in the long term.",
      "Outcome3": "However, cheap air fares also have some negative social and cultural consequences that should not be ignored. first of all, the mass tourism enabled by low-cost flights may lead to the loss of local identity and diversity, as many destinations become homogenized and commodified to cater to the tourists' demands. secondly, the increased pressure on the natural resources and environment caused by the influx of visitors may result in degradation, pollution, and depletion of the ecosystems and wildlife that sustain the local communities. thirdly, the frequent and rapid movement of people across borders may facilitate the spread of diseases and pathogens, posing a threat to the public health and safety of both the travelers and the host populations. therefore, cheap air fares are not only a matter of convenience and affordability, but also a matter of ethical and environmental concern.",
      "Outcome4": "However, not everyone agrees that cheap air fares are harmful to the environment and society. some people might argue that cheap air fares have some positive effects, such as increasing mobility, diversity, and tourism. they might claim that by making air travel more accessible and affordable, people can enjoy more opportunities to visit different places, learn from other cultures, and contribute to the development of the destinations they visit. they might also point out that tourism is a vital source of income and employment for many countries, especially those in the developing world, and that cheap air fares can help them attract more visitors and stimulate their economic growth.",
      "Outcome5": "However, cheap air fares also have some negative impacts on the environment and society. the increasing demand for air travel contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, which threaten the biodiversity and natural resources of many destinations. furthermore, cheap air fares may encourage mass tourism and overconsumption, which can damage the local culture, heritage, and environment. some tourists may also behave irresponsibly or disrespectfully towards the host communities, causing social conflicts and resentment. therefore, cheap air fares are not a sustainable solution for the long-term development of the travel industry and the world.",
      "Outcome6": "However, despite the positive impacts of cheap air fares, there are also significant negative consequences that cannot be ignored. one of the most serious problems is the environmental damage caused by the increasing amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted by airplanes. according to some estimates, air travel accounts for about 5% of global warming, and this figure is expected to rise as the demand for flights grows. furthermore, cheap air fares also contribute to the loss of cultural diversity and authenticity, as many destinations become overcrowded, commercialized, and homogenized by mass tourism. therefore, cheap air fares may not be as beneficial as they seem at first glance."

      "Outcome1": "Distance education is a form of learning that uses technology to deliver instruction and communication between teachers and students who are not physically present in the same location. distance education can take various forms, such as online courses, video conferencing, correspondence, or blended learning. distance education can offer flexibility, convenience, and accessibility to learners who may face barriers to attending traditional school, such as geographical distance, personal commitments, or health issues. however, distance education also has some drawbacks and challenges that may affect its effectiveness and quality.",
      "Outcome2": "However, distance education also has some advantages that traditional school cannot offer. for example, distance education can provide more flexibility and convenience for students who have busy schedules, family responsibilities, or health issues. distance education can also offer more access and diversity for students who live in remote areas, have limited resources, or want to learn from different cultures and perspectives. distance education can also foster more self-motivation and independence for students who are willing to take charge of their own learning.",
      "Outcome3": "However, distance education also has some challenges and drawbacks that may make it less suitable for some students. one of the main difficulties is the lack of face-to-face interaction and socialization with teachers and peers. distance learners may feel isolated, lonely, or bored, and may miss the opportunities to exchange ideas, get feedback, or participate in group activities. another challenge is the need for self-discipline and motivation. distance learners have to manage their own time, set their own goals, and overcome any technical or personal problems that may arise. they also have to adapt to different modes of communication, such as online forums, video conferencing, or email. these skills may not be easy to acquire or maintain, especially for students who are used to the structure and guidance of a traditional classroom.",
      "Outcome4": "Therefore, distance education has both advantages and disadvantages for students. while it offers flexibility, convenience, and accessibility, it also requires self-discipline, motivation, and interaction skills. distance education can be a good option for some students who have specific needs or preferences, but it can't replace traditional school for everyone. traditional school provides a structured environment, social interaction, and direct feedback that are essential for effective learning.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, distance education has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it is not suitable for everyone. some students may benefit from the flexibility, convenience, and cost-effectiveness of online courses, while others may struggle with the lack of interaction, feedback, and motivation. distance education can be a useful alternative or supplement to traditional school, but it cannot replace it entirely.",

      "Outcome6": "However, relying solely on the internet and computer for education may have some drawbacks that need to be considered. for one thing, not all information on the web is accurate, reliable, or appropriate for learners of different ages and levels. without the guidance and feedback of a qualified teacher, students may encounter misinformation, bias, or inappropriate content that could harm their learning outcomes or critical thinking skills. for another thing, the internet and computer cannot replace the human interaction and socialization that are essential for developing communication, collaboration, and emotional skills. learning from a teacher also fosters respect, trust, and rapport between students and educators, which can motivate and inspire them to achieve their goals."

      "Outcome1": "One of the most appealing benefits of a vegetarian diet is its potential to improve health and prevent diseases. firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxidant which can prevent cancer. this fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. moreover, a vegetarian diet can also help reduce the risk of other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources. therefore, a vegetarian diet can provide adequate nutrition and promote wellness for people who choose it.",
      "Outcome2": "However, health improvement is not the only factor to consider when choosing a vegetarian diet. some critics point out that there are also potential drawbacks and risks associated with avoiding animal products. for instance, vegetarians may face deficiencies in some essential nutrients such as iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin b12, and omega-3 fatty acids, which are mainly found in meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. these nutrients are vital for the proper functioning of the immune system, the nervous system, the blood formation, the bone health, and the brain development. therefore, vegetarians need to supplement their diet with fortified foods or pills to avoid negative health consequences. moreover, some people may experience digestive problems, food allergies, or intolerances when consuming large amounts of plant-based foods, especially those that are high in fiber, lectins, or oxalates. these substances can interfere with the absorption of minerals, cause bloating, gas, or inflammation, and increase the risk of kidney stones or gout. thus, a vegetarian diet is not necessarily suitable for everyone and requires careful planning and monitoring.",
      "Outcome3": "One way to elaborate on the evidence and sources that support the claim that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxidant is to cite some specific examples and studies that demonstrate their effects. for instance, according to the american institute for cancer research, cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, and kale have compounds that can modulate the activity of enzymes involved in detoxification and inflammation, which may reduce the risk of some cancers. similarly, a meta-analysis of 95 studies by imperial college london found that high intake of fruits and vegetables, especially those rich in vitamin c, carotenoids, and flavonoids, was associated with lower mortality and lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases and some cancers. these findings suggest that a vegetable diet can provide a variety of antioxidants that can protect the cells from oxidative stress and damage.",
      "Outcome4": "However, not everyone is convinced that a vegetarian diet is beneficial for health. some critics claim that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, which is essential for building and repairing muscles, bones, and tissues. they argue that animal products such as meat, eggs, and dairy are the best sources of complete protein, which contains all nine essential amino acids that the human body cannot produce on its own. without adequate protein intake, they warn, vegetarians may suffer from fatigue, weakness, and poor immunity.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the most common reasons why people choose to follow a vegetarian diet is the belief that it can improve their health. according to many studies, vegetables are rich in antioxidants that can protect the body from cancer and other diseases. therefore, many vegetarians claim that eating more plants and less animal products can benefit their well-being. however, some critics of vegetarianism argue that meat is essential for providing enough protein, which is vital for building and repairing tissues. they question whether vegetarians can get enough protein from plant sources, such as beans and peas, which are often considered as alternatives to meat.",
      "Outcome6": "Besides the health benefits of a vegetarian diet, another reason for its popularity is the ethical and environmental concerns of many people. some vegetarians choose not to eat meat because they oppose the killing and suffering of animals for food. they also believe that a plant-based diet is more sustainable and eco-friendly than a meat-based one. by avoiding meat, they reduce their carbon footprint, water consumption, and land use. therefore, a vegetarian diet can be seen as a way of expressing one's values and compassion for other living beings."

      "Outcome2": "Finding a new place for living in another planet is very significant for the survival of humanity, especially in the face of the potential threats from outer space. for instance, some scientists warn that a large asteroid could collide with the earth and cause a global catastrophe, similar to the one that wiped out the dinosaurs millions of years ago. moreover, the earth's resources are finite and its environment is deteriorating due to overpopulation, pollution, and climate change. therefore, exploring space could offer new opportunities for scientific discovery, resource extraction, and colonization, which could benefit humanity in the long term.",
      "Outcome3": "However, finding a new place for living in other planets is not an easy task, as it involves many challenges and obstacles that prevent human beings from achieving this goal of space colonization. some of these challenges are scientific, such as the distance, the environment, the resources, and the adaptation of life forms to different conditions. some of these challenges are ethical, such as the impact of human activities on the existing ecosystems, the rights and responsibilities of the colonizers, and the potential conflicts with other civilizations. some of these challenges are political, such as the regulation, the cooperation, the competition, and the security of the space activities. therefore, exploring space requires not only technological advancement, but also social, moral, and legal frameworks that can address these issues.",

Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition.",
      "Right": "Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important."

      "Outcome2": "Living in a higher pace condition has many advantages over living in a lower pace condition, especially for me who has ambitious goals and aspirations. when i live in a higher pace condition, i can accomplish more tasks in a shorter time, challenge myself to improve my skills and abilities, and seize more opportunities that may arise in my field of interest. on the contrary, when i live in a lower pace condition, i may miss some deadlines, lose some motivation and enthusiasm, and settle for less than what i am capable of. therefore, living in a higher pace condition is more desirable for me, as it can help me achieve more satisfaction and fulfillment in my life. apart from the one i have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is...",

      "Outcome4": "One of the main reasons why i prefer to live in a higher pace condition is that it can help me achieve my goals or dreams more effectively. living in a higher pace condition means that i have to set clear and challenging objectives for myself and work hard to accomplish them within a given time frame. this can motivate me to improve my skills, knowledge, and abilities in various fields and overcome any obstacles or difficulties that i may encounter. living in a higher pace condition can also prevent me from getting lazy, which is a detrimental habit that can hinder my progress and performance. by keeping myself busy and engaged in meaningful activities, i can avoid wasting time and energy on trivial or unproductive matters and focus on what really matters to me. for example, when i was preparing for a piano competition, i had to practice playing piano regularly and intensively, which not only enhanced my musical talent but also prevented me from getting distracted by other temptations or distractions. as a result, i was able to win the competition and fulfill my dream of becoming a pianist. therefore, living in a higher pace condition can be beneficial for my personal and professional development.",

      "Outcome5": "However, some people may argue that professors should not neglect research completely, as it can also benefit students in different ways. research can help professors update their knowledge and keep up with the latest developments in their fields, which can enrich their teaching materials and methods. research can also provide opportunities for students to participate in projects and experiments, which can stimulate their interest and creativity, as well as enhance their practical skills and problem-solving abilities. for example, electronic students can learn from their professors' research on new machines and devices, and apply their theoretical knowledge to invent their own products. therefore, research can be seen as a complementary and supportive activity for teaching, rather than a competing and distracting one.",
      "Outcome6": "However, some people may argue that research is not only beneficial for professors, but also for students. they claim that professors could teach students through research and projects, and that this would stimulate students' creativity and interest in their fields. they may cite examples of students who have invented new devices or won awards by participating in research."

Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.",

      "Outcome1": "The harmful effects of smoking in restaurants are not only theoretical, but also supported by scientific evidence and statistics. according to the world health organization, exposure to secondhand smoke can cause lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory infections, among other diseases. moreover, secondhand smoke can worsen the symptoms of asthma, bronchitis, and allergies in children and adults. a study by the american journal of public health found that restaurant workers who worked in smoking areas had higher levels of nicotine and cotinine, a by-product of tobacco, in their blood and urine than those who worked in smoke-free areas. these workers also reported more respiratory problems, headaches, eye irritation, and nausea than their counterparts. therefore, smoking in restaurants not only violates the rights of the customers and staff to breathe clean air, but also puts their health and well-being at risk.",
      "Outcome2": "Banning smoking in restaurants can benefit the society in many ways. first of all, it can protect the public health of the customers and the staff from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke, which can cause various diseases such as cancer, asthma, and heart problems. second, it can improve the environment of the restaurants by reducing the air pollution, the fire hazards, and the littering of cigarette butts. third, it can boost the economy of the restaurants by attracting more customers who prefer a smoke-free atmosphere, increasing the productivity and morale of the staff, and saving the costs of cleaning and ventilation. therefore, banning smoking in restaurants is a reasonable and beneficial policy that should be supported by everyone.",
      "Outcome3": "However, some people may argue that smoking is a personal choice and that banning it in restaurants infringes on their freedom and rights. they may also claim that they can smoke in designated areas or use ventilation systems to reduce the harm of secondhand smoke. these arguments are not convincing because they ignore the overwhelming evidence that smoking is harmful not only to the smokers themselves, but also to the people around them. designated areas or ventilation systems cannot completely eliminate the exposure to secondhand smoke, which contains more than 7,000 chemicals, many of which are carcinogenic or toxic. moreover, smoking in restaurants violates the right of non-smokers to breathe clean air and enjoy their meals without being exposed to unpleasant smells and health risks. therefore, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants for the sake of public health and welfare.",
      "Outcome4": "As discussed above, smoking in restaurants is a harmful practice that can endanger the health of the customers, the staff, and the environment. it can also reduce the quality of the food and the service, and create a unpleasant atmosphere for the non-smokers. therefore, smoking should not be banned in restaurants for the sake of everyone's well-being and satisfaction. this is the main argument of this essay, which has been supported by various evidence and examples.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, it is clear that smoking in restaurants has many negative impacts on the health and well-being of the customers and the staff. not only does it expose them to harmful chemicals and carcinogens, but it also creates an unpleasant and unhygienic environment for dining. moreover, it can influence the behavior and development of the children, the elderly, and the pregnant women who visit the restaurants with their families.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, smoking in restaurants is not only harmful for the smokers themselves, but also for the people around them who have to inhale the secondhand smoke. it can cause various health problems, such as respiratory infections, asthma, cancer, and heart disease. moreover, it can create an unpleasant and unsafe environment for the customers and the staff who want to enjoy their food and service."

      "Outcome1": "Traditions are not only a way of preserving the past, but also a source of identity and pride for the present and future generations. however, many traditions are facing the threat of extinction due to the rapid changes in society, culture, and technology. for example, some indigenous languages, crafts, dances, and rituals are in danger of disappearing as their speakers and practitioners become fewer and less interested. these traditions are not only expressions of artistic and creative skills, but also symbols of the collective memory and wisdom of a certain group of people. they embody their struggles, beliefs, values, and aspirations, and enrich the diversity and heritage of humanity.",
      "Outcome2": "Preserving traditions is not only a matter of honoring the past, but also a way of enriching the present and the future. by keeping alive the diverse and distinctive skills and ways of life of different cultures, we can foster a sense of identity and belonging among the local communities, as well as a sense of curiosity and appreciation among the global society. through sharing and learning from each other's traditions, we can enhance our mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation, and address the common challenges and opportunities that we face in the modern world. thus, preserving traditions is not a waste of resources, but a valuable investment in the cultural and social capital of humanity.",
      "Outcome3": "However, the argument that preserving traditions is costly and irrelevant in the modern world is not convincing. firstly, preserving traditions does not necessarily mean rejecting modernization or innovation. on the contrary, traditions can inspire creativity and diversity in various fields, such as arts, crafts, cuisine, music, and literature. for example, many contemporary artists and designers draw on traditional motifs and techniques to create original and distinctive works. secondly, preserving traditions can enhance the cultural identity and social cohesion of a nation or a community. traditions reflect the history, values, beliefs, and customs of a people, and help them to maintain a sense of belonging and pride. moreover, traditions can foster mutual respect and understanding among different groups, as well as attract tourists and visitors who are interested in learning about other cultures. therefore, preserving traditions is not only a matter of heritage, but also a matter of development and harmony.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, this essay has argued that preserving traditions is crucial for maintaining cultural diversity and identity, as well as enriching the quality of life and social cohesion. despite the challenges and costs of protecting traditions, they outweigh the benefits that they bring to the society and the economy. moreover, traditions are not static or outdated, but dynamic and adaptable to the changing environment and needs of the people. therefore, the government and the education sector should cooperate to raise awareness and appreciation of the traditional skills and ways of life, and to support their transmission and innovation for the sake of the present and future generations.",
      "Outcome5": "One way to enhance the appreciation of traditions is to showcase their diversity and richness in various cultural events and festivals. these activities can attract tourists and visitors, as well as local residents, to experience and learn about the traditional skills and ways of life of different ethnic groups and regions. moreover, they can also foster social cohesion and harmony, as people can share and respect the cultural heritage of others. thus, cultural events and festivals are not only beneficial for preserving and promoting traditions, but also for stimulating the economy and society.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the ways to demonstrate the value of traditions is to show how they can enrich the cultural diversity and identity of a nation and its people. traditions are not only relics of the past, but also sources of inspiration and creativity for the present and the future. by preserving and promoting the traditional skills and ways of life, the government and education institutes can foster a sense of pride and belonging among the citizens, as well as attract more tourists and investors who are interested in the unique and authentic aspects of the country. moreover, traditions can also help to preserve the ecological balance and the social harmony of the communities, as they often reflect the wisdom and the adaptation of the ancestors to the natural and historical environment."

Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.",
      "Right": "Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "However, following the local customs does not mean that immigrants have to abandon their own cultural identities. in fact, they can benefit from learning and respecting the norms and values of their adopted countries, while also preserving and sharing their own heritage and traditions. for example, immigrants can celebrate their religious festivals and national holidays, while also participating in the local events and activities. they can also learn the language and customs of their new country, while also teaching their children their native tongue and history. they can also enjoy the cuisine and arts of their host country, while also cooking and displaying their own food and crafts. by doing so, they can enrich their own lives and contribute to the cultural diversity and harmony of their new society.",
      "Outcome2": "Therefore, sustaining one's cultural identity is not only beneficial for the immigrants themselves, but also for the diversity and harmony of their adopted countries. they can contribute their unique skills, perspectives, and experiences to the society, while respecting and learning from the local customs. however, there is another reason why immigrants should not abandon their cultural traditions in the destination countries. it is related to their family ties and their children's well-being.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the main reasons why immigrants should preserve their cultural identities is to support their children's well-being and development. children of immigrants may face various social troubles in school, such as language barriers, discrimination, bullying, or cultural conflicts. these challenges can affect their self-esteem, academic performance, and mental health. therefore, parents should help their children cope with these difficulties by providing them with emotional, cultural, and linguistic support. for example, parents can encourage their children to learn and speak their native language at home, to celebrate their cultural festivals and rituals, and to share their stories and experiences with their peers. moreover, parents can find friends from their same country or community and organize social activities and events for their children and themselves. this way, they can create a sense of belonging, solidarity, and pride among their children and maintain their cultural ties and values.",
      "Outcome4": "Maintaining one’s cultural identity is not only beneficial for the individual and their family, but also for the destination country. by preserving their value of origin, immigrants can contribute to the diversity and richness of the culture and society they live in. they can share their unique perspectives, experiences, and skills with others, and learn from different traditions and beliefs. they can also promote mutual respect and understanding among different groups, and foster a sense of belonging and inclusion. therefore, keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is not a sign of rejection or isolation, but rather a way of enhancing the harmony and vitality of the multicultural community.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the ways that immigrants can sustain their cultural identities in their adopted countries is by practicing their religious beliefs and celebrating their festivals. these activities not only help them preserve their heritage and values, but also enrich the diversity and tolerance of the host society. for example, muslims can observe ramadan and eid, hindus can celebrate diwali and holi, and chinese can enjoy lunar new year and mid-autumn festival. by doing so, they can express their faith and identity, as well as share their customs and traditions with their neighbors and friends.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, preserving one’s cultural identity is not only beneficial for the individual, but also for the society as a whole. by following the local customs, immigrants can show respect and appreciation for their host country and its people, as well as learn from their diversity and richness. however, this does not mean that they have to abandon or neglect their own heritage and values, which are part of their identity and personality. on the contrary, they can share and celebrate their culture with others, and contribute to the multiculturalism and harmony of their adopted country. moreover, they can maintain a sense of belonging and connection with their roots, and pass on their traditions and beliefs to their children, who may otherwise lose touch with their ancestral background."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The quality of students who enter college and university is a controversial topic that has different perspectives and arguments. first of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. the reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. college and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. they believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university. however, this view is not shared by everyone, and there are some who argue that college and university should be more inclusive and diverse in their admission criteria.",
      "Outcome2": "However, this view is too narrow and ignores the benefits of diversity and inclusion in higher education. in this essay, i will argue that college and university should not only accept good students, but also mediocre students who have other qualities and skills that can enrich the learning environment and contribute to society.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the main arguments in favor of selecting only good students for higher education is that they deserve to pursue their academic goals and benefit from the opportunities that college and university offer. good students have demonstrated their commitment, ability, and interest in learning, and they are more likely to excel in challenging and demanding courses. by choosing good students, higher education institutions can ensure that they provide quality education and foster a culture of excellence and innovation. moreover, good students can contribute to the academic community and society by applying their knowledge and skills to solve problems, create new knowledge, and improve their fields of study. therefore, good students have earned the right to study in higher education and should not be denied this privilege.",
      "Outcome4": "However, this argument is not convincing because it ignores the fact that there are different types of intelligence and learning styles, and that academic performance is not the only indicator of a student's ability and potential. for example, some students may excel in creative or practical subjects, but struggle with standardized tests or memorization. some students may have learning disabilities or personal challenges that affect their grades, but have other strengths and talents that could benefit from higher education. some students may simply need more guidance and support to overcome their difficulties and improve their skills. therefore, judging students based on their grades alone is unfair and narrow-minded, and could deprive them of the opportunity to pursue their interests and goals.",
      "Outcome5": "However, this view is not fair and reasonable for several reasons. firstly, the definition of a good student is subjective and may vary depending on different criteria and expectations. some students may excel in academic performance, but lack creativity or interpersonal skills. others may have diverse talents and experiences, but face challenges in standardized tests or language barriers. secondly, college and university education is not only about acquiring knowledge, but also about developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and lifelong learning abilities. these skills can benefit students of different levels and backgrounds, and help them overcome their weaknesses and discover their interests. thirdly, excluding mediocre students from higher education opportunities can limit their potential and career prospects, and create social and economic inequalities. by offering them access and support, college and university can foster a more inclusive and diverse learning environment, and prepare students for the changing and complex world.",
      "Outcome6": "However, this view is not fair and beneficial for both the institutions and the students. there are many reasons why mediocre students should also have the opportunity to pursue higher education and improve their academic performance."

      "Outcome2": "Developing the agriculture products is not only beneficial for the economy of my country, but also for the preservation of our culture and identity. the centre of research in agriculture can help us to achieve this goal by applying scientific methods and innovations to improve the quality, quantity and diversity of our crops and livestock. for example, the centre of research can introduce new varieties of dates that are more resistant to pests and diseases, or that have higher nutritional value and longer shelf life. the centre of research can also explore the potential of other agriculture products, such as fruits, vegetables, herbs, honey and dairy, that can enhance our food security, health and income. by doing so, the centre of research can support the farmers and the rural communities, as well as the consumers and the exporters, of our country.",

      "Outcome5": "Therefore, newspapers are facing many challenges in the modern era, such as the rise of digital media, the decline of readership, the loss of advertising revenue, and the environmental impact of paper production. these factors have forced newspapers to adapt to the changing preferences and needs of their audiences, as well as to the ethical and ecological standards of society. however, despite these difficulties, newspapers still have some advantages and roles that cannot be easily replaced by other forms of media, such as their credibility, diversity, depth, and influence.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is evident that newspapers are facing various challenges and threats in the modern era, from the competition of digital media to the decline of readership and advertising revenue. however, these are not the only factors that put newspapers at risk of extinction. there is also another aspect that cannot be ignored, which is the environmental impact of newspaper production."

      "Outcome1": "One of the issues that many cities face is how to balance the preservation of their historical and cultural heritage with the demands of modern development and population growth. old buildings, which often reflect the architectural and artistic styles of different periods and civilizations, can be seen as valuable assets that enrich the urban landscape and attract tourists and scholars. however, some people argue that restoring old buildings is not a wise or feasible option, and that they should be replaced by new and more functional structures. there are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. as a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values.",
      "Outcome2": "Some people argue that old buildings should be restored to preserve the cultural heritage and architectural diversity of a city. however, i disagree with this view and believe that restoring old buildings is not a wise use of resources and space. in this essay, i will explain why i think that people should not restore old buildings and why the reasons given by the left text are more convincing than those given by the right text.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the main arguments against restoring old buildings is that they occupy valuable space that could be used for more urgent needs, such as housing for the growing urban population. this argument assumes that old buildings have no practical or cultural value for the present and future generations, and that they are only a burden for the public budget. however, this view ignores the benefits that old buildings can bring to the urban environment and the society. in the following paragraphs, i will examine some of these benefits and show why restoring old buildings is not only desirable, but also necessary.",
      "Outcome4": "Some people argue that old buildings should be restored because they represent the cultural heritage and identity of a society. they claim that old buildings reflect the historical events, artistic styles, and social values of the past generations and that they can educate and inspire the present and future ones. moreover, they contend that old buildings can attract tourists and generate income for the local economy and that they can enhance the aesthetic and environmental quality of the urban landscape. for example, the restoration of the colosseum in rome, the forbidden city in beijing, and the taj mahal in agra has not only preserved their architectural and historical significance, but also increased their popularity and revenue as world heritage sites.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people argue that old buildings should not be restored for various reasons related to the urbanization process and the high cost of preservation. however, others might disagree with this view and claim that old buildings have cultural and aesthetic significance that should not be neglected. they might point out that old buildings reflect the identity and heritage of a community, and that they can attract tourists and generate income. moreover, they might suggest that old buildings can be adapted to new functions and needs, such as museums, offices, or housing, without losing their original character and charm. therefore, they might advocate for a balanced approach that respects and protects old buildings while also addressing the challenges of urban development.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main arguments against restoring old buildings is that they occupy valuable space that could be used for new development. as a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. another reason why some people oppose the restoration of old buildings is that it involves a high cost and a complex process. besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. therefore, some people may think that it is not worth investing in old buildings that may not have much practical use or appeal for modern society."

      "Outcome2": "It is undeniable that salary plays a crucial role in meeting the physical demands of human life, especially in the modern world where the cost of living is constantly rising. many people have to work hard to afford basic necessities such as food, shelter, clothing, health care, and education for themselves and their families. moreover, some people may need to save money for future plans, such as buying a house, starting a business, or traveling. therefore, for many people, choosing a job that offers a high and stable income is a rational and pragmatic decision.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the reasons why i suppose that other aspects are as important as income when people choose a job is personal interest. i think that working in a field that matches our interest and passion can motivate us to perform better and enjoy our work more. moreover, personal interest can also reflect our values and goals in life, which are essential for our well-being and happiness. for example, some people may value creativity, innovation, or social justice, and pursue careers that allow them to express and fulfill these values. others may have specific goals, such as traveling the world, learning new languages, or making a difference in their community, and look for jobs that can support and facilitate these goals. therefore, personal interest can be a powerful factor that influences our career choices and outcomes.",

      "Outcome5": "Therefore, i disagree with the idea that salary is the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. although income is undoubtedly an important factor that affects people's living standards and choices, it is not the only one that matters. in fact, focusing too much on salary may lead to neglecting other aspects of a job that can affect one's well-being, performance, and motivation.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, i disagree with the idea that salary is the most dominant factor in determining one's career path. although money is certainly necessary to meet basic needs and enjoy some comforts, it is not the only source of motivation and fulfillment for workers. in fact, pursuing a career solely based on income may lead to boredom, stress, burnout, or ethical dilemmas. moreover, it may prevent people from discovering and developing their true talents and potentials."

      "Outcome2": "One of the main advantages of cooking fresh food is that it can provide a variety of dishes that are easy to prepare and nutritious. for example, a simple salad with fresh vegetables, cheese, nuts, and dressing can be a satisfying and healthy meal that takes only a few minutes to make. similarly, a stir-fry with lean meat, tofu, or eggs and some seasonal vegetables can be cooked in a wok or a skillet with some oil, soy sauce, and spices. another option is to make a soup or a stew with beans, lentils, or chicken and some herbs, broth, and vegetables. these dishes can be served with bread, rice, or noodles and offer a balanced diet that supports the immune system, the digestive system, and the brain function. cooking fresh food does not have to be complicated or time-consuming, and it can also be a way of expressing creativity, culture, and love.",
      "Outcome3": "However, cooking fresh food is not always easy or feasible for everyone. some people may face challenges or drawbacks, such as lack of time, high cost, or limited availability of fresh ingredients. for example, some people may have long working hours, tight schedules, or multiple responsibilities that leave them little time or energy to cook. others may live in areas where fresh food is scarce, expensive, or seasonal, and have to rely on prepared food or processed alternatives. these factors may make cooking fresh food seem impractical or unaffordable for some people.",
      "Outcome4": "Therefore, it is advisable for people who rely on prepared foods to reconsider their dietary habits and find some alternatives. for example, they could plan ahead and cook some healthy meals in bulk and freeze them for later use, or choose some prepared foods that are low in salt, fat, and additives and supplement them with fresh fruits and vegetables. they could also allocate some time on weekends or holidays to cook with their family or friends and enjoy the process and the benefits of fresh food. by doing so, they could not only improve their nutrition and health, but also preserve and share their culinary traditions and culture.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, it is important to avoid relying too much on prepared foods and to make time for cooking fresh food whenever possible. cooking fresh food not only provides more nutrition, but also preserves the traditions and flavors of different cuisines. by cooking fresh food, people can also enjoy the process of preparing and sharing meals with their families and friends, which can enhance their social and emotional well-being. cooking fresh food is a valuable skill and a rewarding habit that can benefit people in many ways.",
      "Outcome6": "However, the convenience of prepared foods comes at a high cost for our well-being and identity. not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. it is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up. moreover, cooking fresh food is not only a way of nourishing our bodies, but also a way of expressing our culture and traditions. by relying on prepared foods, we are losing the opportunity to learn and share our culinary heritage, which is an important part of our social and emotional development. therefore, we should not underestimate the value of cooking fresh food for ourselves and our families."

      "Outcome1": "In the era of rapid technological development and globalization, many people may wonder whether traditional skills and lifestyles have any value or relevance in modern society. however, there are many reasons to appreciate and preserve the diverse and rich heritage of human history, which encompasses various forms of knowledge, practices, arts and crafts. traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit.",
      "Outcome2": "Some examples of traditional skills and lifestyles that can benefit modern people in terms of health, environment and culture are gardening, yoga, meditation, pottery, weaving, folk music and dance. gardening can help people to grow their own organic food, exercise, relax and connect with nature. yoga, meditation and other forms of mind-body practices can improve physical and mental well-being, reduce stress and enhance self-awareness. pottery, weaving and other crafts can stimulate creativity, express emotions and preserve cultural heritage. folk music and dance can enrich the diversity of artistic expressions, foster social bonds and celebrate cultural identity. these activities can also be sources of income, education and enjoyment for many people.",
      "Outcome3": "However, preserving and promoting traditional skills and lifestyles is not without challenges and limitations in the face of modernization and globalization. on the one hand, some traditional skills and lifestyles may be incompatible with the demands and expectations of the contemporary market and society, such as efficiency, productivity, and innovation. on the other hand, some traditional skills and lifestyles may face the risk of losing their authenticity, diversity, and vitality due to the influence of mass media, consumerism, and cultural homogenization. therefore, it is essential to find a balance between respecting and safeguarding the heritage and values of traditional skills and lifestyles and adapting and integrating them into the dynamic and complex reality of modern society.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, this essay has argued that traditional skills and lifestyles play an important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. it has shown that technology, while bringing convenience, also poses some challenges to human well-being, and that traditional ways of life can offer a balance and a complement to modern life. it has also demonstrated that traditional skills are more sustainable and respectful of the environment, and that they carry the wisdom and values of ancient cultures that can enrich and inspire modern civilization. therefore, protecting and promoting tradition is not only a matter of preserving the past, but also a way of enhancing the present and preparing for the future.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, it is clear that traditional skills and lifestyles have a lot of benefits for modern society, in terms of health, environment and culture. they can help people to maintain a balanced and healthy life, to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and to preserve the heritage of their ancestors. these are valuable assets that should not be neglected or forgotten in the face of rapid technological development. protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is evident that traditional skills and lifestyles have a significant role in modern society, not only as a source of diversity and richness, but also as a means of enhancing health, sustainability and cultural continuity. while technology and innovation are essential for progress and development, they should not overshadow or replace the valuable knowledge and wisdom that have been passed down from generation to generation."

      "Outcome2": "Zoos have existed for thousands of years, dating back to ancient civilizations that kept exotic animals as symbols of power and prestige. however, the modern concept of zoos emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries, when scientific and educational motives became more prominent. zoos claim to serve various functions, such as conservation, research, education, and entertainment, but they also face criticism and controversy from animal rights activists, environmentalists, and ethical philosophers. some people argue that zoos are beneficial for both humans and animals, as they raise awareness, foster empathy, and support endangered species. others contend that zoos are cruel, unnatural, and unnecessary, as they deprive animals of their freedom, dignity, and well-being. the debate over the role and morality of zoos is complex and multifaceted, and it involves different perspectives and values. however, one of the main points of contention is whether zoos can provide a suitable environment for wild animals, or whether they are inherently harmful and oppressive. this leads to the question of whether animals have the right to live in a natural habitat away from human interference, or whether they can adapt and thrive in a captive setting. the following paragraphs will examine the arguments for and against zoos from this angle.",
      "Outcome3": "Some people may argue that zoos are beneficial for wild animals, as they can provide them with food, shelter, and medical care. they may also claim that zoos can educate the public about the importance of wildlife conservation and raise awareness of the threats that many species face in the wild. however, i disagree with this view and believe that zoos are harmful and unethical for wild animals. to begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a natural environment away from human beings. given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. moreover, if wild animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. as a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. it seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.",

      "Outcome5": "However, some people may argue that zoos have positive roles to play in conserving wildlife and educating the public. they claim that zoos can provide a safe haven for endangered species, rescue and rehabilitate injured or orphaned animals, and conduct scientific research and breeding programs. furthermore, they contend that zoos can raise awareness and appreciation of the diversity and value of wildlife among visitors, especially children, and inspire them to take action to protect the environment. according to this view, zoos are not only a source of entertainment, but also a means of conservation and education.",

      "Outcome3": "However, the excessive and compulsive use of the mobile phone can also have negative consequences for people's well-being. mobile phone addiction can interfere with people's social relationships, mental health, and productivity in various ways. for instance, some people may neglect their face-to-face interactions with their family, friends, or colleagues and become isolated or alienated. others may experience anxiety, stress, or depression if they cannot access their phone or receive constant notifications and messages. moreover, some people may lose their focus, concentration, or creativity and perform poorly at work, school, or other tasks due to the distraction and dependence on their phone. therefore, it is important to balance the benefits and risks of the mobile phone and use it in a moderate and responsible manner.",
      "Outcome4": "Setting limits: people can set realistic and specific goals for how much time and money they want to spend on their mobile phones, and use apps, timers, or alarms to remind them of their limits. they can also turn off unnecessary notifications, avoid using their phones during meals, bedtime, or work, and keep their phones out of sight or reach when they are not needed.",

      "Outcome1": "Cheap flights have become more popular and accessible in recent years, offering many benefits and opportunities for travelers and businesses. however, they also have some serious drawbacks, especially for the environment. on the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airports that may increase the air pollution for people who live and work close to them. however, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. burning plane fuel can release carbon dioxide into the environment that causes the earth to heat up. in fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce co2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to rein in the airlines.",
      "Outcome2": "Cheap flights not only make travelling more affordable and convenient for people, but also bring benefits to the tourism industry. for example, cheap flights can attract more visitors to different destinations, creating more jobs and income for local businesses and communities. cheap flights can also increase cultural exchange and diversity, as people can experience different customs, languages and cuisines. furthermore, cheap flights can enable people to visit their relatives and friends more often, strengthening their social ties and well-being.",
      "Outcome3": "Growing of cheap flights has not only economic but also environmental consequences. on the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. one of the reasons is that more flights require more infrastructure and resources to accommodate the increasing demand for air travel. this leads to bigger and busier airports that may expand into natural habitats, consume more energy and water, and generate more noise and waste. moreover, bigger and busier airports also mean more air pollution for people who live and work close to them, as they are exposed to higher levels of harmful emissions from planes, vehicles, and machinery. however, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the earth to heat up. in fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce co2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, cheap flights have both advantages and disadvantages for people and society. they can offer more opportunities for travel, education, and business, but they can also create more competition, inequality, and cultural erosion. on the other hand, cheap flights have a serious negative impact on the environment, as they contribute to air pollution and global warming. while other sectors are trying to reduce their carbon footprint, the aviation industry seems to be expanding without any regulation or accountability. therefore, i believe that cheap flights should be limited and taxed more to discourage excessive flying and to encourage more sustainable modes of transport.",
      "Outcome5": "On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. however, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the earth to heat up. in fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce co2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. this is a serious problem, as aviation is one of the fastest growing sources of greenhouse gas emissions in the world. according to some estimates, flying accounts for more than 2% of global co2 emissions, and this figure could rise to 15% by 2050 if no action is taken. therefore, it is important to consider the environmental costs of cheap flights and find ways to reduce their impact.",

Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive.",

      "Outcome2": "Email communication also allows me to provide some examples or evidence to support my points and opinions, which might not be possible or convenient in voice or face-to-face conversations. for instance, when i want to persuade my parents to let me study abroad, i can attach some documents or links that show the benefits and opportunities of the program, the requirements and costs, and the testimonials of other students who have done it. this way, i can show them that i have done my research and that i have a clear plan and goal. in contrast, if i try to explain these things verbally, they might interrupt me, question me, or dismiss me without giving me a chance to finish or prove my case. email communication gives me more space and time to present my arguments and evidence in a logical and coherent way.",
      "Outcome3": "However, email communication is not without its drawbacks and challenges. sometimes, email messages can be misinterpreted, delayed, ignored, or lost in the inbox. email communication also lacks the immediacy, tone, and body language of face-to-face or voice conversations, which can affect the emotional and social aspects of communication. therefore, email communication may not be the best choice for urgent, sensitive, or complex issues that require immediate feedback, clarification, or negotiation. in such situations, other methods of communication, such as phone calls, video calls, or face-to-face meetings, might be more appropriate and effective.",
      "Outcome4": "To sum up, email is an effective and convenient way of communication that can overcome the barriers of time, distance, and emotions. it allows people to express themselves clearly, politely, and fluently, without the pressure and interruptions of voice or face-to-face conversations. therefore, i think email is better than other methods of communication for me and many others who share similar situations. email helps me communicate with my parents, friends, and teachers more confidently and successfully.",
      "Outcome5": "To achieve fluency in communication, email also has some advantages over voice email or face-to-face conversations, especially for people who are shy or reserved. email allows them to organize their thoughts and arguments clearly and logically, without being interrupted or distracted by the reactions or opinions of the listeners. this can help them express themselves more confidently and persuasively, and avoid forgetting or omitting important points. for instance, when i have to talk to my parents about something that they might disagree with, i find it easier and more effective to write an email than to speak to them directly.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, e-mail is not only a convenient and fast way of communication, but also a tool to improve our writing skills and fluency. by writing e-mails, we can practice how to organize our thoughts, use appropriate vocabulary and grammar, and avoid misunderstandings. moreover, e-mail gives us more time and space to think and express ourselves clearly and confidently. this is especially helpful for those who are shy or nervous in oral communication. for instance, i find it easier to communicate with my parents through e-mail than face-to-face."

Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "One of the most pressing issues facing many urban areas today is the lack of affordable and adequate housing for the growing population. as the demand for accommodation exceeds the supply, the prices of rent and property soar, putting a heavy burden on low- and middle-income households. in this situation, the role of governmental financial aid is crucial to ensure that everyone has access to decent living conditions. however, there is a debate on how the government should allocate its funds for housing: should it prioritize new building construction or old building preservation? in this essay, i will argue that new building construction deserves more governmental investment than old building preservation, for two main reasons: it can create more housing units and jobs, and it needs more resources and management than old building preservation.",
      "Outcome2": "Some might argue that preserving historic and traditional buildings is also a way of addressing the housing shortage, as they can be renovated and adapted for modern use. they might also claim that preserving old buildings is more environmentally friendly and culturally valuable than constructing new ones. however, these arguments are not convincing or sufficient for several reasons. first, renovating old buildings often entails high costs and technical challenges, especially if they are protected by heritage laws or have structural problems. second, preserving old buildings does not necessarily increase the supply of affordable and accessible housing, as they might be occupied by wealthy or privileged groups or used for commercial or tourist purposes. third, constructing new buildings does not mean ignoring or destroying the cultural and historical significance of old buildings, as they can be integrated or complemented by appropriate design and planning. therefore, new building construction deserves more governmental investment than old building preservation.",
      "Outcome3": "New building construction not only alleviates the housing shortage, but also brings economic and social benefits to the society. by investing in new buildings, the government can create more jobs for the workers, engineers, architects, and suppliers involved in the construction industry. these jobs can boost the income and consumption of the people, and generate more tax revenue for the public services. moreover, new buildings can improve the living standards of the residents, by providing them with modern facilities, energy efficiency, and safety. new buildings can also enhance the urban landscape and the environmental quality, by replacing the old and dilapidated structures that may pose hazards or pollution. therefore, new building construction deserves more governmental investment than old building preservation.",
      "Outcome4": "Therefore, i strongly believe that the government should prioritize new building construction over old building preservation when allocating financial aid for housing. the housing shortage is a pressing social issue that affects the well-being and dignity of millions of people, and the cost of accommodation is becoming increasingly unaffordable. new building construction can provide more and better housing options for the public, as well as stimulate the economy and create jobs. on the other hand, old building preservation is less urgent and less beneficial, and it often involves complex and expensive legal and technical challenges. the government has the responsibility and the capacity to address the housing crisis by investing more in new building construction, which is a wise and compassionate choice for the present and the future of the nation.",
      "Outcome5": "To address the housing shortage and the rising cost of accommodation, the government should prioritize new building construction over old building preservation. new building construction can provide more affordable and modern housing options for the people, especially for the low-income and vulnerable groups. moreover, new building construction can also stimulate the economy and create more job opportunities for the workers.",
      "Outcome6": "However, some may argue that preserving historic and traditional buildings is also a way of providing more accommodation, as well as maintaining cultural heritage and aesthetic value. they may point out that old buildings can be renovated, adapted, or converted for different purposes, such as residential, commercial, or educational. moreover, they may claim that old building preservation can create jobs, attract tourism, and enhance the identity and diversity of the city. while these arguments are not without merit, they overlook the limitations and challenges of old building preservation, especially when compared to new building construction."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "One of the main advantages of learning in a classroom is that it could provide more information than online courses. this is because in a classroom, students can interact with their teachers and peers, ask questions, clarify doubts, and receive feedback. they can also access various resources, such as textbooks, libraries, laboratories, and field trips, that may not be available or convenient in online settings. moreover, in a classroom, students can benefit from the diversity of perspectives, experiences, and cultures of their classmates, which can enrich their learning and broaden their horizons. therefore, learning in a classroom could enhance the depth and quality of students' knowledge.",
      "Outcome2": "Another advantage of classroom learning is that it offers more diverse and interactive sources and methods of learning than online learning. for example, in a classroom, students can access various materials, such as books, journals, newspapers, and posters, that may not be easily available or accessible online. they can also participate in different activities, such as experiments, demonstrations, debates, and presentations, that can enhance their understanding and application of the concepts they learn. these sources and methods of learning can stimulate their curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking skills, which are essential for academic success and lifelong learning.",
      "Outcome3": "Another disadvantage of distance learning is that it could not provide knowledge about social skills. social skills are essential for personal and professional development, as they enable people to communicate effectively, cooperate with others, and resolve conflicts. however, online classes limit the opportunities for students to interact with their peers and teachers, and to practice these skills in real situations. for instance, in a classroom, a teacher could give an assignment to students to work as a group. this could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group, and how to handle different opinions and perspectives. this important skill cannot be obtained in online classes, where students may only communicate through chat or video calls, or work individually.",
      "Outcome4": "One of the main benefits of distance learning is that it allows learners to access education from anywhere and at any time, regardless of their location, schedule, or personal circumstances. however, this flexibility also comes with some drawbacks, especially when it comes to developing social skills. in contrast to online learning, classroom learning offers more opportunities for learners to interact with their peers and teachers, to participate in group activities and discussions, and to receive immediate feedback and support. these interactions can foster social skills such as communication, cooperation, conflict resolution, and empathy, which are essential for personal and professional success. online learning, on the other hand, may limit the quality and quantity of social interactions, as learners may face technical issues, isolation, or lack of motivation. while some online courses may try to incorporate collaborative tools and platforms, such as chat rooms, forums, or video conferences, they may not be able to replicate the same level of engagement and intimacy as face-to-face interactions. therefore, online learning may not provide adequate knowledge and practice of social skills.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the main advantages of distance learning is that it offers flexibility and convenience for learners who have busy schedules or live far away from school. however, this does not mean that it can replace the rich and diverse experience of learning in a classroom. learning in a classroom could provide more information to study, as well as opportunities to develop other essential skills. in the following paragraphs, i will explain why online classes cannot replace classroom learning in terms of social skills and problem-solving abilities.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the reasons why i disagree with replacing classroom learning with distance learning is that classroom learning can provide more information to study. unlike online courses, which may have limited resources and interactions, classroom learning can expose students to a variety of materials, perspectives, and feedback from teachers and peers. moreover, classroom learning can also enhance students' critical thinking and analytical skills, as they can participate in discussions, debates, and presentations that challenge their assumptions and opinions. therefore, classroom learning can offer a richer and deeper learning experience than online courses."

      "Outcome1": "The internet, if used properly, can be a powerful tool for enhancing learning outcomes and skills in various fields of study. for example, the internet can provide access to a vast amount of information and resources that can supplement textbooks and lectures, such as online databases, journals, videos, podcasts, and interactive simulations. the internet can also facilitate communication and collaboration among students and teachers, such as through online forums, chats, blogs, and wikis, where they can exchange ideas, feedback, and perspectives. moreover, the internet can foster creativity and innovation, as students can use various online platforms and tools to create and share their own digital products, such as websites, podcasts, blogs, and multimedia presentations. by engaging with the internet in these ways, students can develop critical thinking, research, communication, and digital literacy skills that are essential for the 21st century.",
      "Outcome2": "Nevertheless, some critics may argue that the internet has several drawbacks that can affect the education system negatively, for instance, internet abuse and black webs. they might claim that the internet exposes students to harmful or inappropriate content, distracts them from their academic tasks, or facilitates cheating and plagiarism. however, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the internet, not the internet itself. thus, what we need to do is to change learners' attitude, not to eliminate the internet from academic study. moreover, there are ways to prevent or minimize these risks, such as using filters, parental controls, or academic integrity policies, as well as educating students about the ethical and responsible use of the internet. therefore, the benefits of the internet for education outweigh its potential drawbacks, as long as it is used wisely and appropriately.",
      "Outcome3": "To conclude, the internet is a valuable tool for education that can provide a wealth of information, opportunities, and benefits for students and teachers. rather than blaming the internet for its potential drawbacks, such as internet abuse and black webs, we should focus on educating students on how to use it responsibly and ethically. the internet itself is not the problem, but the way some students misuse it. therefore, we need to foster a positive and constructive attitude towards the internet in academic study.",

      "Outcome5": "Hence, the internet can be a powerful tool for enhancing students' learning outcomes and developing their skills, if used properly and responsibly. instead of banning or limiting the internet access for students, educators should guide them to use it wisely and ethically, and to avoid harmful or unreliable sources of information. moreover, students should be taught how to evaluate the credibility and relevance of the online materials they encounter, and how to cite them appropriately in their academic work. by doing so, students can benefit from the internet as a rich and diverse resource for learning, while avoiding its potential pitfalls.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, the internet is a powerful and beneficial tool for education, as long as it is used appropriately and responsibly. instead of blaming the internet for its potential drawbacks, educators and students should focus on how to harness its advantages and avoid its pitfalls. for example, they can develop digital literacy skills, such as evaluating online sources, avoiding plagiarism, and protecting personal information. they can also use the internet to access a wide range of learning resources, collaborate with peers and experts, and enhance their creativity and critical thinking. by doing so, they can make the most of the internet as a means of enriching their education and preparing themselves for the future."

      "Outcome5": "This argument suggests that the green economy is not only beneficial for the environment, but also for the economic growth and development of the countries that adopt it. by producing and consuming goods and services that minimize environmental impacts and enhance natural resources, these countries can gain a competitive edge in the global market and improve their living standards. however, not all countries have the same capacity and opportunity to pursue this path, especially those that face poverty, inequality and instability.",
      "Outcome6": "Hence, it is clear that the protection of the environment is not only a moral duty, but also a smart business strategy in the modern world. by investing in green technologies and practices, companies can gain competitive advantages and meet the increasing demands of environmentally conscious consumers. however, not all regions and countries have the same opportunities and capacities to pursue a green economy. some of them are still struggling with poverty, inequality and environmental degradation. this is where the role of the developed countries becomes crucial."

      "Outcome2": "Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. for example, i realized the true potential of my body and mind as i decided to train myself hard. training hard challenged me to overcome physical and mental barriers, to push myself beyond my limits, and to discover new strengths and abilities. i learned to appreciate the value of discipline, perseverance, and resilience, and to respect my own efforts and achievements. even if i were not to win this medal, i acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as i could keep my tired legs running.",
      "Outcome3": "Therefore, setting a clear and challenging goal can boost our self-esteem and confidence by making us aware of our own capabilities and efforts. however, achieving our goal also brings us another benefit: recognition and appreciation from others. in the next paragraph, i will discuss how winning the medal enhanced my social value and motivated me to pursue further excellence.",

      "Outcome5": "Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. for example, i realized the true potential of my body and mind as i decided to train myself hard. even if i were not to win this medal, i acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as i could keep my tired legs running. this sense of achievement and self-respect motivated me to pursue my passion and overcome any obstacles. secondly, committing to our goal also helps developing valuable skills and habits. as i followed a strict schedule and diet, i learned how to manage my time, energy, and resources effectively. i also became more disciplined, resilient, and focused. these skills and habits not only improved my performance, but also benefited other aspects of my life, such as my studies, relationships, and health.",
      "Outcome6": "Committing to our goal not only helps creating personal worth, but also fosters resilience and perseverance. these qualities are essential for overcoming challenges and setbacks that we may encounter along the way. for example, when i faced a serious injury that threatened to end my running career, i did not give up on my dream of winning a medal. instead, i used my goal as a motivation to recover and train harder than ever."

      "Outcome2": "Health education is another important aspect of prevention that can help citizens make informed choices about their health and well-being. for instance, health education programs can teach people about the benefits of regular physical activity, balanced nutrition, stress management, and avoiding tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. these programs can also raise awareness about the signs and symptoms of common chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cancer, and encourage people to seek early diagnosis and treatment. furthermore, health education activities can promote positive behaviors such as hand washing, safe sex, and immunization, and dispel myths and misconceptions about health issues. by providing accurate and accessible information and skills, health education can empower people to take charge of their own health and prevent potential complications.",
      "Outcome3": "Health education and prevention are not only right and wise, but also beneficial for both individuals and society. by raising awareness and providing information on healthy lifestyles, risk factors, and preventive services, health education can empower people to make informed choices and avoid unnecessary illnesses and injuries. prevention can also reduce the burden of disease and disability on the health system, as well as the economic and social costs of treatment. however, prevention is not enough to ensure the health of all citizens. there are still some situations where treatment is necessary and unavoidable. in the following paragraph, we will discuss how treatment can be improved and made more accessible and affordable.",
      "Outcome4": "Not only is prevention beneficial for individuals and communities, but it also has clear advantages over treatment in terms of cost-effectiveness and sustainability. treatment, on the other hand, often involves expensive and complex procedures, medications, and equipment, which may not be accessible or affordable for many people, especially in low-resource settings. moreover, treatment may not always be successful or sufficient to cure or manage chronic or emerging diseases, which may require long-term care and follow-up. therefore, treatment can impose a heavy burden on the health system and the economy, as well as on the patients and their families. by contrast, prevention can reduce the incidence and severity of diseases, and thus the need for treatment, by promoting healthy behaviors, providing immunization, screening, and counseling, and addressing the social and environmental determinants of health.",
      "Outcome5": "To implement this wise policy of focusing on health education and preventative measures, the government and the citizens should cooperate and take action. the government should provide adequate funding, infrastructure, and personnel to support health education programs and vaccination campaigns. the citizens should participate actively in learning about the importance of prevention, the risks of infectious diseases, and the benefits of immunization. they should also follow the recommendations of health professionals and authorities on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid exposure to harmful factors. by doing so, they will contribute to the improvement of their own health and the public health of the country.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main advantages of focusing on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment is that it can reduce the burden of disease and disability on individuals, families, and society. by providing people with accurate and accessible information about how to prevent and manage common health problems, such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and mental disorders, health education can empower them to make informed choices and adopt healthy behaviors. moreover, by implementing effective and affordable interventions, such as immunization, screening, counseling, and sanitation, preventative measures can protect people from the risk of contracting or transmitting infectious and chronic diseases, as well as detect and treat them early before they become more severe and costly."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Choosing what subjects to study is a crucial decision for students, as it can affect their interests, skills, and career prospects. by exploring different fields of knowledge, students can discover their passions and talents, and develop their critical thinking and creativity. moreover, having a choice of subjects can motivate students to learn more effectively and enjoy their education. however, not all students have the same opportunities to choose what they want to study. some may face limitations or pressures from their parents, schools, or society, which can undermine their autonomy and potential. this is why students should have a right to choose what they want to study. not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. as children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.",
      "Outcome2": "However, some people may argue that not all subjects are equally essential or practical for students' future careers or lives, and that allowing students to choose what they want to study may result in them neglecting core skills or knowledge. they may also claim that students may not have enough knowledge or experience to make informed choices about what subjects they are interested in or suited for, and that they may regret their decisions later or miss out on valuable opportunities.",
      "Outcome3": "Some might argue that students should not have too much freedom in choosing their subjects, because they might neglect the essential skills and knowledge they need for their future careers and lives, or because they might lack the ability to make informed and responsible decisions. however, these counterarguments are not convincing, because students can balance their interests and requirements, develop critical thinking and creativity, and seek guidance if needed. for example, students can choose some elective subjects that match their passions and talents, while also fulfilling the core requirements of their curriculum and the standards of their desired colleges or universities. by doing so, they can enrich their learning experience, discover new perspectives, and enhance their motivation and engagement. moreover, students can develop critical thinking and creativity by exploring different fields and topics, which can help them to solve problems, communicate effectively, and adapt to changing situations. students can also seek guidance from teachers, parents, or counselors if they are unsure or confused about their choices, and receive feedback and support to make the best decisions for themselves. therefore, students should have a right to choose what they want to study, as it can benefit their personal and academic development.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, this essay has argued that students should have a right to choose what they want to study in school. this is not only a matter of respecting their human rights, but also of supporting their personal development and aspirations. by allowing students to pursue their interests and passions, they can develop their skills, talents and potential, and contribute to the society and the economy in a positive way. therefore, it is important that the education system does not impose limitations or restrictions on students' choices, but rather provides them with opportunities and guidance to explore and learn.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, students should not be forced to study subjects that they have no interest or aptitude in, as this would only demotivate them and waste their potential. instead, they should be encouraged to pursue their passions and talents, and be provided with a variety of options and resources to help them succeed in their chosen fields. by allowing students to have a say in their education, we can foster a culture of creativity, innovation, and diversity, and prepare them for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.",
      "Outcome6": "This argument for students' freedom of choice is based on the premise that education is a fundamental human right, and that each individual has the potential and the aspiration to pursue their own interests and passions. however, not everyone agrees with this view, and some might argue that there are other factors that should influence the curriculum and the selection of subjects."

However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.",

I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department."

      "Outcome1": "One of the most important characteristics of a good co-worker is cooperation. this means that he or she is willing to share ideas, resources, and responsibilities with others in order to achieve a common goal. a cooperative co-worker also respects the opinions and abilities of others and does not try to dominate or undermine them. cooperation is essential for creating a harmonious and productive work environment. for example, when i worked on a project with a team of four co-workers, we divided the tasks according to our strengths and interests, and we communicated regularly to update each other on our progress and challenges. we also helped each other whenever we faced difficulties or needed feedback. as a result, we completed the project on time and with high quality, and we received positive feedback from our supervisor and clients.",
      "Outcome2": "Cooperation is one of the essential characteristics of a good co-worker, as it enables the team to work efficiently and effectively towards a common goal. when co-workers cooperate, they share their skills, knowledge, and resources, and they support each other in overcoming challenges and solving problems. cooperation also enhances the quality of the work, as co-workers can provide constructive feedback, improve their performance, and avoid errors and conflicts. moreover, cooperation boosts the morale of the co-workers, as they feel valued, respected, and appreciated by their peers, and they enjoy a positive and harmonious work atmosphere.",
      "Outcome3": "Cooperation is essential for a good co-worker, but it is not enough. cooperation alone cannot ensure a harmonious and productive work relationship if there is no trust between co-workers. trust is another vital characteristic that a good co-worker needs to have, because it affects the communication, the morale, and the performance of the team. a co-worker who is trustworthy is honest, reliable, and respectful of others. he or she does not spread rumors, sabotage, or compete unfairly with his or her colleagues. a trustworthy co-worker also respects the privacy and the confidentiality of others, and does not misuse or abuse the information or the resources that are shared with him or her. trust builds confidence, loyalty, and mutual support among co-workers, and prevents conflicts and misunderstandings. a lack of trust, on the other hand, can lead to serious problems and damages in the work environment, as the following example illustrates.",
      "Outcome4": "One of the most important characteristics of a good co-worker is trustworthiness, which means being honest, reliable, and loyal to the team and the organization. trustworthiness can help co-workers to collaborate effectively, avoid conflicts, and achieve their goals. for example, when i worked as a project manager for a software company, i had a co-worker who was very trustworthy. he always delivered his tasks on time, communicated clearly, and supported me whenever i needed his help. he never tried to undermine me or take credit for my work. because of his trustworthiness, i could rely on him and delegate some of the responsibilities to him. this enabled me to focus on the strategic aspects of the project and ensure its quality and success. he also earned the respect and appreciation of our clients and senior managers. his trustworthiness was a valuable asset for our project and our work environment.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the characteristics of a good co-worker that i mentioned is trustworthiness. this means that a good co-worker should be honest, reliable, and loyal to his or her team members. he or she should not spread false or malicious information, sabotage the work of others, or take credit for someone else's achievements. trustworthiness is essential for building a strong and productive team that can work together effectively and harmoniously. a lack of trustworthiness can cause conflicts, resentment, and mistrust among co-workers, which can damage the work environment and the quality of the work. i have witnessed how mistrust can create problems in my own department, as i will illustrate with an example.",

      "Outcome1": "However, environmental pollution is not the only problem caused by automobiles. another serious issue is the traffic congestion that affects many urban areas around the world. traffic congestion not only wastes time and fuel, but also increases the stress and frustration of the drivers and passengers. moreover, traffic accidents are more likely to occur in crowded and chaotic roads, resulting in injuries and deaths. therefore, besides changing the vehicles, it is also important to improve the public transportation system and to encourage people to use it more often. additionally, some measures such as road pricing, carpooling, and bicycle lanes could also help to reduce the traffic volume and to promote a more sustainable and healthy lifestyle.",
      "Outcome2": "The development of modern transportation has brought many benefits to people's lives, such as convenience, mobility, and accessibility. however, it also has some negative consequences, especially for the environment and human health. one of the most serious problems is the overuse and dependence on automobiles, which have various harmful effects on the natural and social systems. in this essay, i will argue that it is necessary to reduce the number of automobiles and promote alternative modes of transportation, as well as to enact laws and regulations to limit their environmental damage. firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxide emissions have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.",
      "Outcome3": "As the world population grows and urbanization expands, more and more people rely on automobiles for their daily transportation. however, this trend has some serious drawbacks for the environment and human health. in this essay, i will discuss two major problems caused by the excessive use of automobiles and suggest some possible solutions. firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.",
      "Outcome4": "One of the main drawbacks of the increasing number of automobiles is the environmental pollution they cause. automobiles emit harmful substances such as nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and greenhouse gases, which contribute to smog, acid rain, and climate change. these pollutants not only degrade the natural environment, but also affect the health of the people who breathe them. studies have shown that exposure to high levels of air pollution from automobiles can increase the risk of lung cancer, asthma, heart disease, and premature death. therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the negative effects of urbanization is the growth of traffic congestion and the use of private vehicles. firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles. secondly, traffic congestion also wastes time and energy of the drivers and passengers, as well as increases the risk of accidents and road rage. moreover, traffic congestion affects the economic efficiency and productivity of the urban areas, as it delays the delivery of goods and services, and reduces the accessibility and mobility of the workers and consumers. hence, it is necessary to improve the public transportation system and to encourage the use of alternative modes of travel, such as walking, cycling, or carpooling.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the alternative means of transportation that can reduce the environmental pollution caused by automobiles is public transit. public transit, such as buses, trains, and subways, can carry more passengers with less fuel consumption and emission than individual cars. moreover, public transit can ease traffic congestion and save travel time and cost for commuters. hence, public transit is a more sustainable and efficient way of moving people around the city. however, to promote the use of public transit, it is necessary to provide adequate infrastructure, service, and incentives for the potential users."

However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.",
      "Right": "Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Many people cast doubt on standardized tests because they think that they are unfair, stressful, and narrow the curriculum. they argue that standardized tests do not measure the true abilities and potential of students, but rather their ability to memorize facts and follow instructions. they also claim that standardized tests put too much pressure on students and teachers, who have to prepare for them and meet certain benchmarks. moreover, they worry that standardized tests force teachers to teach to the test, leaving out important topics and skills that are not covered by the exams. however, i disagree with these criticisms and i think that standardized tests have many benefits for the educational system. standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.",
      "Outcome2": "One way that standardized tests help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge is by providing them with reliable and comparable data on the students' performance. teachers can use the test results to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their students, as well as the areas that need more attention or improvement. for example, if a teacher notices that many students are struggling with a certain topic or skill, they can adjust their instruction or provide extra support accordingly. standardized tests can also help teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of their curriculum and teaching methods, and to align them with the state or national standards and expectations. by using standardized tests as a tool for feedback and improvement, teachers can enhance the quality of education and ensure that all students have equal opportunities to learn.",
      "Outcome3": "Standardized tests are not only useful for assessing students' knowledge, but also for measuring some of the skills or abilities that are essential for their future. for example, standardized tests can evaluate students' critical thinking, problem-solving, reasoning, and communication skills, which are in high demand in the modern world. by taking standardized tests, students can demonstrate their ability to analyze, synthesize, apply, and communicate information in different contexts and formats. these skills can help students to cope with various challenges and opportunities in their academic, professional, and personal lives. therefore, standardized tests can be seen as a valuable tool for preparing students for the future.",
      "Outcome4": "To sum up, standardized tests are beneficial for the educational system and the students, as they provide a reliable way to measure learning outcomes and encourage critical thinking skills. by taking regular standardized exams, students can demonstrate their mastery of the curriculum and challenge themselves to solve problems independently. therefore, i strongly support the idea that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as they are fair, valid, and aligned with the learning objectives.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the main reasons why i support standardized tests is that they can help teachers to assess the students' progress and identify their strengths and weaknesses. by using the results of these exams, teachers can adjust their teaching methods and provide feedback and support to the students who need it most. moreover, teachers can also use standardized tests to evaluate the effectiveness of their curriculum and instruction, and to compare the performance of their students with other schools or districts. therefore, standardized tests can be a useful tool for improving the quality of education and ensuring that all students have equal opportunities to learn.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main benefits of standardized tests is that they can provide useful feedback for teachers and students. by analyzing the test results, teachers can identify the strengths and weaknesses of their students, as well as the effectiveness of their teaching methods. they can then adjust their instruction accordingly, or provide extra support or enrichment for students who need it. students, on the other hand, can also learn from their mistakes and improve their skills and knowledge. furthermore, standardized tests can motivate students to study harder and prepare well for the exams."

    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "One of the most debated issues in some countries is whether stringent gun control, which refers to strict laws and regulations that limit the access, ownership, and use of firearms, can effectively reduce violence and crime. some proponents of gun control argue that by restricting the availability of guns, especially for civilians, the risk of accidental shootings, suicides, homicides, and mass shootings would be lower. however, others contend that this approach is ineffective and infringes on the rights and freedoms of law-abiding citizens.",
      "Outcome2": "One way to illustrate how most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally is to look at the statistics of gun trafficking and theft. according to the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives (atf), in 2019, more than 23,000 firearms were reported lost or stolen from licensed dealers, while more than 420,000 firearms were reported lost or stolen from private owners. moreover, a study by the university of pittsburgh found that nearly 80% of guns used in crimes in pittsburgh in 2008 were not owned by the perpetrators, but were obtained through straw purchases, illegal transfers, or theft. these findings suggest that gun control laws that target legal gun owners and dealers are unlikely to prevent criminals from accessing firearms. all in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. on the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.",
      "Outcome3": "In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. people who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. moreover, gun control might also have negative consequences for law-abiding citizens who use guns for self-defense or recreation. they might face difficulties in acquiring or keeping firearms that could protect them from potential threats or enhance their enjoyment of hunting or shooting sports. gun control might also infringe on their constitutional rights and liberties, as well as their sense of personal responsibility and empowerment. all in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. on the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.",
      "Outcome4": "Both texts argue that gun control is not an effective way to reduce violence and crime, but they focus on different aspects of the issue. the left text claims that most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally, so stricter regulations would not deter criminals and gangs who can access the black market. the right text, however, examines the role of police carrying guns and how it influences the violence rate in different countries. it suggests that there is no clear correlation between the presence of armed police and the level of violence, and that other factors, such as the criminal mind, are more relevant. therefore, both texts propose that the solution to violence and crime lies in changing people's behaviors, rather than in restricting gun ownership.",
      "Outcome5": "However, some might argue that gun control is not the only factor that influences violence and crime rates. they might point out that the presence or absence of armed police officers also affects the level of security and deterrence in a society. for example, some countries, such as the united kingdom, have largely unarmed police forces, yet they have lower homicide rates than the united states, which has a heavily armed police force. therefore, they might suggest that the main cause of violence and crime is not the availability of guns, but the criminal mindset of some individuals or groups.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, the argument that gun control can prevent violence and crime by restricting the access of law-abiding citizens to firearms is flawed and unsupported by evidence. rather than focusing on the tools of violence, policymakers and society should address the root causes of criminal behavior and the social and economic factors that fuel gang activity and illegal gun trafficking. the following passage will examine the case of some countries that have strict gun control laws but still suffer from high rates of violence."

      "Outcome1": "Many people argue that affluent people should pay taxes for public school, even if they do not send their own children to these institutions. they claim that this is not only a matter of social responsibility, but also a way of promoting social justice and economic development. in this essay, i will examine two main reasons why paying taxes for public school is beneficial for both the rich and the poor. firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. it is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. with the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.",
      "Outcome2": "This claim is not merely based on an idealistic assumption, but also supported by empirical data. according to a study by the national center for education statistics, public schools in the united states serve more than 50 million students, of whom about 20 million are from low-income families. these students benefit from free or reduced-price lunch programs, title i funding, and other federal and state grants that are partly funded by taxes. moreover, the study also found that public schools tend to have more diverse student bodies and offer more opportunities for academic and extracurricular enrichment than private schools. therefore, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people not only contribute to the public good, but also help to create a more equitable and inclusive society.",
      "Outcome3": "Paying taxes for public school, therefore, can be seen as a way of promoting social justice and enhancing the human capital of the nation. by supporting the education of the less privileged, affluent people not only fulfill their civic duty, but also foster a more diverse and productive society. however, not all wealthy individuals agree with this view. some may argue that they have the right to choose how to spend their money and that they should not be forced to subsidize a system that does not benefit them or their children. they may also question the quality and efficiency of public education and prefer to opt for private or alternative options. in the following paragraphs, we will examine the validity and implications of these objections.",
      "Outcome4": "However, this argument is flawed for several reasons. first, paying taxes for public school does not guarantee that the quality of education will be equally high for all students, regardless of their socio-economic status. in fact, many public schools are underfunded, overcrowded, and lack qualified teachers and resources, especially in low-income areas. therefore, the gap between rich and poor may widen rather than narrow, as the affluent can still choose to send their children to private schools or supplement their education with extra-curricular activities and tutoring. second, paying taxes for public school does not address the root causes of poverty, such as unemployment, discrimination, lack of access to health care, and social injustice. these factors affect not only the academic performance of students, but also their well-being, motivation, and opportunities for the future. therefore, paying taxes for public school is not enough to ensure that all children have a fair chance to succeed and improve their quality of life. third, paying taxes for public school may not reflect the preferences and values of the taxpayers themselves. some people may prefer to support other causes or organizations that align with their beliefs or interests, rather than being forced to fund a system that they do not agree with or benefit from. for example, some people may oppose the curriculum, the teaching methods, or the policies of public schools, and may want to have more control over their children's education. therefore, paying taxes for public school may infringe on the freedom and autonomy of the taxpayers. in conclusion, paying taxes for public school is not a sufficient or effective way to narrow down the gap between rich and poor. instead, the government should adopt more comprehensive and targeted measures to address the underlying issues of poverty and inequality, and to provide equal opportunities and quality education for all students. the main thesis of this essay is that affluent people should not be obliged to pay taxes for public school, as it is unfair, inefficient, and counterproductive.",
      "Outcome5": "Public education is often seen as a way to promote social justice and equality of opportunity for all citizens. however, some people may argue that affluent people should not have to pay taxes for public schools that they do not use, and that they should have the freedom to choose private education for their children. in this essay, i will counter this argument by showing how paying taxes for public schools benefits both the rich and the poor in society. firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. it is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. with the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life. secondly, by supporting public education, affluent people also benefit from a more educated and skilled workforce, which can enhance the productivity and competitiveness of the economy. a well-educated population can also foster innovation, creativity, and social cohesion, which are essential for a democratic and prosperous society. therefore, paying taxes for public schools is not only a moral obligation, but also a smart investment for the rich.",
      "Outcome6": "For the affluent, paying taxes for public school can enhance their social responsibility and reputation, as well as reduce the potential risks of social unrest and crime caused by inequality and resentment. for the poor, receiving free or subsidized education can empower them to acquire knowledge and skills, improve their employability and income, and break the cycle of poverty and dependence."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Education and preventative measures are two important aspects of the health system that aim to reduce the risk of diseases and promote healthy behaviors among the population. education refers to the process of providing information, skills, and motivation to individuals and groups on how to prevent and manage health problems, such as chronic diseases, infectious diseases, mental health, and substance abuse. preventative measures refer to the actions and interventions that are implemented before the onset of a disease or injury, such as immunization, screening, counseling, and environmental protection. these measures can help to avoid or delay the need for treatment and reduce the burden on the health system. the first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. i believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.",
      "Outcome2": "One way that education and preventative measures can decrease the number of patients in the health system is by promoting healthy lifestyles and behaviors that can prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. for example, educating people about the benefits of regular physical activity, balanced nutrition, and avoiding tobacco and alcohol can help them reduce the risk of developing these conditions and the complications that may arise from them. another way is by increasing the awareness and access to preventive services such as screenings, vaccinations, and counseling that can detect and prevent potential health problems before they become serious or costly. for example, educating people about the importance of getting regular check-ups, mammograms, pap smears, and immunizations can help them prevent or treat infections, cancers, and other diseases that may require hospitalization or surgery. by educating and preventing health issues, the number of patients in the health system can be reduced, which can lead to better management and treatment for those who need it.",
      "Outcome3": "By reducing the number of patients in the health system, hospitals and healthcare centers can offer better treatments for those who need them. this can benefit the society as a whole in several ways. for example, better treatments can reduce the mortality and morbidity rates of diseases, which can improve the quality of life and productivity of the population. moreover, better treatments can also lower the costs of healthcare, which can free up resources for other social and economic needs. furthermore, better treatments can enhance the trust and satisfaction of the public in the health system, which can foster a sense of social cohesion and responsibility. therefore, investing in education and preventative measures can have positive impacts on the health outcomes and well-being of the society.",
      "Outcome4": "To sum up, i have argued that education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget than treatment because they can improve the health system by reducing the number of patients. this can benefit both the current and the future patients by providing them with better and more efficient care. however, this is not the only advantage of investing more in education and prevention. in the next paragraph, i will discuss another reason why this approach can have positive impacts on society and the economy.",
      "Outcome5": "Moreover, education and preventative measures can also have positive impacts on the economy and the environment. by reducing the burden of diseases and health costs, society can allocate more resources to other productive sectors and improve the living standards of the population. additionally, by promoting healthy lifestyles and behaviors, such as physical activity, nutrition, and hygiene, education and preventative measures can help prevent environmental degradation and pollution caused by excessive consumption and waste. thus, investing in education and preventative measures can benefit not only the health system, but also the overall well-being and sustainability of the society.",
      "Outcome6": "To support this argument, i will present some evidence that shows how education and preventative measures can reduce the burden on the health system and improve the quality of care for patients. for example, according to the world health organization, chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer are responsible for 60% of all deaths worldwide and account for 80% of the health expenditure in low- and middle-income countries. however, many of these diseases can be prevented or delayed by adopting healthy behaviors such as avoiding tobacco, alcohol, and unhealthy diets, and engaging in physical activity. therefore, investing in health education and promotion programs can help people to adopt these behaviors and prevent or reduce the risk of developing chronic diseases, which in turn can save resources and improve outcomes for the health system."

Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results.

By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained.

      "Outcome6": "Therefore, taking on a part time job can be a wise and rewarding choice for students who want to enrich their academic and personal lives. however, it is also important to balance the workload and the study time, and to avoid any negative impacts on their health and well-being. a part time job should not distract students from their main goals and responsibilities as learners, but rather complement and enhance them."

      "Outcome2": "Some of the communication tools that make it easy to make new friends are social media platforms, online forums, chat rooms, and video calls. these tools allow people to share their interests, opinions, hobbies, and personal information with others who have similar or compatible profiles. they also enable people to interact with each other in real time, exchange messages, voice notes, photos, and videos, and see each other's facial expressions and gestures. these features help to create a sense of connection, intimacy, and trust among online friends, and sometimes lead to offline meetings and relationships.",
      "Outcome3": "Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. according to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via internet. in this sense, internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends. for instance, some people joined online dating platforms, where they could find compatible matches based on their preferences, hobbies, and values. others participated in online communities, forums, or social media groups, where they could share their interests, opinions, and experiences with like-minded people. through these online interactions, many people developed romantic relationships that led to marriage or long-term commitment. online dating also offered some benefits, such as saving time and money, avoiding awkwardness and pressure, and expanding the pool of potential partners. therefore, technology enhanced the quality and diversity of people's social and romantic connections. by way of conclusion, i once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.",
      "Outcome4": "Online communication has not only facilitated the exchange of information and ideas, but also enhanced the social and emotional aspects of human relationships. people can share their feelings, interests, and hobbies with others across the globe, and find support, encouragement, and companionship. moreover, online communication offers another benefit that is often overlooked: comfort. in the following paragraph, i will explain how technology has made communication more comfortable and convenient for people.",
      "Outcome5": "However, not everything is positive about the use of technology for communication. some people argue that it can also create some problems, such as isolation, addiction, cyberbullying, or loss of privacy. they claim that relying too much on technology can reduce the quality and depth of face-to-face interactions, as well as the sense of belonging and identity. moreover, they warn that technology can expose users to various risks, such as hacking, fraud, or harassment, and that it can also affect their mental and physical health. therefore, they suggest that people should balance their use of technology with other forms of communication and socialization, and be aware of the potential dangers and ethical issues involved.",
      "Outcome6": "However, not everything is positive about the online communication. some people may argue that it also has some drawbacks, such as reducing face-to-face interaction, increasing the risk of cyberbullying, or exposing personal information to strangers. these are valid concerns that need to be addressed by educating users, enforcing regulations, and promoting ethical and responsible use of technology. nevertheless, these challenges do not outweigh the benefits of having a diverse and convenient way of communicating with others across the globe."

      "Outcome2": "In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or hiv will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. on the other hand, many common and chronic diseases can be avoided or reduced by adopting healthy lifestyles and habits. for instance, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and stroke can be prevented by maintaining a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption. similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance. therefore, investing in one's health and well-being can save a lot of money and suffering in the long run.",
      "Outcome3": "The benefits of preventing diseases are not only personal, but also social and environmental. according to the world health organization, the global cost of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, is projected to reach $47 trillion by 2030, which is equivalent to 4% of the world's gross domestic product. these diseases also contribute to the depletion of natural resources, pollution and climate change, as they increase the demand for energy, water, food and medical waste. therefore, by adopting healthy lifestyles and habits, such as exercising, eating well, avoiding tobacco and alcohol, and using preventive health-care products, humans can not only reduce their risk of developing these costly and debilitating conditions, but also save money and resources for themselves and the society.",
      "Outcome4": "One of the reasons why people should pay more attention to their health is that their behavior and decision making are influenced by various factors, such as social norms, personal beliefs, emotions, and cognitive biases. these factors can affect how people perceive and evaluate health risks, how they seek and process health information, how they cope with stress and uncertainty, and how they choose among different health options. for example, some people may underestimate the likelihood of getting sick or the severity of the consequences, while others may overestimate their ability to control or prevent diseases. some people may follow the health advice of their peers or celebrities, while others may distrust or ignore the scientific evidence. some people may be motivated by positive emotions, such as hope or satisfaction, while others may be driven by negative emotions, such as fear or guilt. some people may rely on intuitive judgments, such as heuristics or stereotypes, while others may use more rational and analytical reasoning. these factors can have both beneficial and harmful effects on people's health outcomes, depending on the context and the situation. in addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or hiv will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, preventing diseases is not only a moral duty for individuals, but also a wise choice for society. by avoiding the risk factors that cause many common and chronic illnesses, people can enjoy a higher quality of life and reduce the burden on the health-care system. in addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or hiv will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance. thus, prevention is better than cure in both ethical and practical terms.",
      "Outcome6": "In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or hiv will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. therefore, it is wise to invest in preventive measures that can reduce the risk of contracting these fatal conditions. for example, by avoiding smoking, excessive drinking, or exposure to harmful substances, one can lower the chances of developing cancer or hiv. similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care products, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance. these habits can not only improve one's physical well-being, but also save a lot of money that would otherwise be spent on medical bills, surgeries, or drugs. thus, prevention is better than cure, both for one's health and wealth."

      "Outcome1": "One reason why discussion face to face is much better than by emails is that it allows team members to communicate more effectively and clearly. when people talk to each other in person, they can use verbal and non-verbal cues, such as tone, gesture, and eye contact, to convey their opinions and emotions. they can also ask questions, clarify misunderstandings, and give feedback immediately, which can enhance mutual understanding and trust. on the contrary, when people communicate by emails, they may lose some of the richness and nuance of face-to-face interaction. they may also encounter delays, misinterpretations, and conflicts due to the lack of context and feedback. therefore, discussion face to face can reduce the chances of confusion and disagreement, and speed up the decision-making process.",
      "Outcome2": "Therefore, face-to-face communication is more effective than email communication when team members need to solve problems or make decisions that require consensus. by talking to each other in person, they can express their views more clearly, listen to each other's feedback, and resolve any misunderstandings or conflicts that may arise. for example, an experiment conducted by the beijing university asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. the first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. the result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. the similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other.",
      "Outcome3": "Both face to face and email communication have their own advantages and disadvantages in team collaboration. face to face communication allows team members to exchange ideas, clarify misunderstandings, and build rapport more effectively than email communication. it also enables them to use nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice, to convey emotions and attitudes. however, face to face communication may also have some drawbacks, such as requiring physical presence, scheduling difficulties, and potential distractions. email communication, on the other hand, offers more flexibility, convenience, and documentation than face to face communication. it allows team members to communicate across different locations, time zones, and devices, and to keep a record of the messages and attachments. however, email communication may also pose some challenges, such as lack of immediacy, feedback, and context. it may also increase the risk of miscommunication, misunderstanding, and conflict due to the absence of nonverbal cues. therefore, team members need to consider the nature, purpose, and urgency of their communication and choose the most appropriate mode accordingly.",

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Violence is a pervasive and disturbing phenomenon in the contemporary world, and it often appears in various forms of media, such as tv, film, video games, and music. while some people argue that media violence is a harmless form of entertainment or a reflection of reality, others contend that it has negative and harmful effects on the society, especially on the young and impressionable audiences. media violence can influence people's attitudes, behaviors, emotions, and values, and it can also contribute to the desensitization, imitation, and legitimization of violence in the real world.",
      "Outcome2": "Media violence is a controversial topic that has been debated for decades. some people argue that media violence is a form of artistic expression that reflects the reality of human nature and society. they claim that media violence can have positive effects, such as catharsis, education, or entertainment, for the audience. on the other hand, media, such as tv or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. it should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. however, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. in this essay, i will argue that media violence should be limited and regulated to prevent negative consequences for the individual and the society.",
      "Outcome3": "Therefore, it is essential to regulate the amount and the quality of violence in media, especially in tv and film, to prevent the negative impacts on the public. media violence can not only desensitize people to real-life violence, but also encourage them to imitate violent behaviors or to adopt violent attitudes. according to a meta-analysis of 217 studies by anderson et al. (2010), exposure to media violence is associated with increased aggression, reduced empathy, and lower moral standards. moreover, media violence can also distort people's perception of reality and create unrealistic expectations or fears. for example, some people may think that violence is a normal or effective way to solve conflicts or to express emotions, or that they are constantly in danger of being attacked or harmed by others. these effects can have serious consequences for individuals and society, such as increased crime rates, mental health problems, or social unrest.",
      "Outcome4": "To sum up, violence in media has both positive and negative impacts on the society. on one hand, it can provide entertainment, catharsis, and education for the audience, as well as stimulate creativity and critical thinking. on the other hand, it can also cause desensitization, imitation, and aggression, as well as distort the reality and misinform the public. therefore, it is important to balance the amount and quality of violence in media, and to foster media literacy and ethical awareness among the consumers. media producers and regulators should also take responsibility for the social and psychological effects of their products, and avoid glorifying or trivializing violence. by doing so, we can enjoy the benefits of media without compromising our values and well-being.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, there is a need to balance the presentation of violence in media and video games, as both of them can have significant impacts on the audience's attitudes and behaviors. while video games can provide entertainment and stress relief, they can also desensitize players to the consequences of violence and increase their aggression and hostility. on the other hand, media can inform and educate the public about the reality of violence, but they can also exaggerate and sensationalize it, creating fear and confusion. both video games and media should be responsible and ethical in their depiction of violence, and avoid glorifying, trivializing, or distorting it. moreover, the audience should be critical and aware of the potential effects of violence exposure, and seek alternative sources of information and coping strategies.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is crucial to balance the representation of violence in media and its impact on the public. while media has the responsibility to inform the audience about the reality of violence, it also has the duty to avoid sensationalizing, glorifying, or normalizing it. excessive violence in media can desensitize the viewers, distort their perception of reality, and trigger aggressive or imitative behaviors. media should also provide context, analysis, and solutions for the causes and consequences of violence, and educate the audience about how to cope with it in a constructive and non-violent way."

      "Outcome3": "One of the negative effects of on-line computer games on students is that they distract them from their academic studies and lower their grades. first and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. an investigation done by beijing university shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. recent research by scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. in contrast, students who avoid or limit their exposure to on-line games tend to focus more on their homework, revision and extracurricular activities, which enhance their skills, knowledge and confidence. for example, a survey conducted by the education bureau of shanghai found that the top 10% of the students in the city spent less than an hour per week on on-line games, and more than 70% of them participated in at least one club or sport in school. therefore, it is clear that on-line games have a detrimental impact on students' academic performance and development.",
      "Outcome4": "The paragraph above illustrates the negative impact of online gaming on students' academic performance, based on statistical and scientific evidence. it suggests that many students are addicted to these games and neglect their studies, while those who excel in school avoid them. however, this problem is not unsolvable and there are some measures that can be taken to help students balance their online and offline activities.",
      "Outcome5": "The left text and the right text both illustrate the negative impact of online computer games on students' academic performance. they provide different types of evidence to support this claim, such as statistics from a university survey and findings from scientific research. the left text focuses on the correlation between online gaming and exam failure, while the right text explains the psychological mechanism behind the addiction and distraction of young gamers. by combining these two texts, the author can present a convincing argument that online computer games are harmful for students' education and should be limited or avoided.",
      "Outcome6": "This phenomenon of online gaming addiction among students is not only detrimental to their academic achievement, but also to their physical and mental health. according to the world health organization, excessive gaming can lead to various problems such as sleep deprivation, eye strain, obesity, anxiety, depression, and social isolation. moreover, some violent and aggressive games may influence the moral values and behaviors of the young players, making them more prone to conflicts and crimes. therefore, it is urgent to raise the awareness of the potential risks of online gaming and to provide effective interventions and guidance for the students who are addicted to it."

      "Outcome2": "One way to avoid the negative consequences of hasty decisions is to have a clear and realistic plan for the future. planning can help a person to identify their goals, assess their options, and prepare for potential challenges. by planning ahead, a person can also evaluate the risks and benefits of any major change, such as quitting a job, and seek advice or support if needed. planning can also help a person to cope with uncertainty and adapt to changing circumstances. therefore, planning is an essential skill for achieving personal and professional success.",

      "Outcome4": "As we can see, hasty decisions can have serious and negative consequences for one's life and well-being. not only does quitting a job without a backup plan lead to financial difficulties and stress, but it also closes the door to future opportunities and career growth. therefore, it is advisable for the readers to avoid making such impulsive and irrational choices and instead, plan wisely and carefully for their goals and aspirations. by doing so, they can ensure that they have a stable and fulfilling life that meets their needs and expectations.",

      "Outcome6": "Therefore, quitting a job without having a clear plan or a backup option is a very risky and unwise move. it can have serious consequences for the person's financial stability, well-being, and future prospects. not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. to put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst. he might regret his impulsive choice and struggle to find another job in a competitive market, or he might face depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues due to the stress and uncertainty of his situation. either way, he would have been better off if he had thought things through and explored other alternatives before leaving his job."

Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me."

      "Outcome1": "Many people admire famous people and think that they have achieved their success by being lucky. they may believe that famous people have some special talent or opportunity that others do not have, or that they are favored by fate or destiny. however, this is a misconception that ignores the hard work and dedication that famous people usually put into their careers. as the left text argues, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people, and they have to work hard to become professional and powerful in their fields. the right text gives an example of how hard work reduces the role of chance in success, by comparing the penalty-kick skills of ronaldo and the writer. the writer acknowledges that ronaldo has a higher chance of scoring a goal from a penalty-kick than the writer, not because ronaldo is luckier, but because he has more practice and exercise than the writer. he spends a lot of time in the football field every day, honing his skills and improving his performance. therefore, it is not fair to attribute his success to luck, but to his effort and discipline.",
      "Outcome2": "The left text argues that famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people, and that hard work makes one more professional and powerful in one's job. the right text illustrates this point with the example of ronaldo, who has more chances of scoring a penalty-kick than the author because of his constant practice and exercise. this example shows how hard work and practice can improve one's skills and performance in any field of work, not just in sports. for instance, a musician who practices regularly and learns from feedback will produce better music than one who relies on talent alone. a scientist who conducts rigorous experiments and updates his or her knowledge will make more discoveries than one who follows outdated theories. a teacher who prepares well and engages with students will have more impact than one who improvises and ignores their needs. therefore, we can see that hard work and practice are essential factors for achieving success and fame in any domain.",
      "Outcome3": "Some people might think that famous people are just lucky, and that their success depends on being in the right place at the right time. however, this view ignores the fact that famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. hard work makes you a professional man/woman who is powerful in his or her job. i mean, when you work hard you decrease the portion of chance in your success. for example, in a football game it is said that a penalty-kick needs good luck to be a goal. statistically, the chance of being a goal is fifty-fifty. but i think ronaldo makes a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. it is not because ronaldo is more fortunate than me. definitely, it is because he has more practice and exercise than me. he does a lot of exercise in the football field every day, so it is not because he is luckier than me. therefore, we can see that success is not a matter of luck, but a matter of effort and skill. luck may play a role sometimes, but it is not the main factor that determines the outcome. rather, it is the result of hard work and dedication that makes someone famous and respected.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, being famous does not necessarily mean being lucky, but rather being hard-working and skilled. by dedicating time and effort to their profession, famous people reduce the role of chance in their success and become more competent and confident. for instance, ronaldo scores more penalty-kicks than me not because he is more fortunate, but because he has more practice and exercise. therefore, we should not attribute fame to luck, but to perseverance and talent. instead of envying or admiring famous people, we should learn from their example and pursue our own goals with passion and determination. what do you think are the qualities and challenges of being famous in today's world?",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, we can conclude that famous people are not merely lucky, but rather they have earned their fame and success through hard work and dedication. they have developed their skills and talents to a high level, and they have overcome many challenges and obstacles along the way. luck may play a role in some situations, but it is not the main factor that determines their achievements. rather, it is their effort and perseverance that make them stand out from the rest.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, we can see that famous people do not achieve their fame and success by mere luck, but by their dedication and effort. they constantly improve their skills and knowledge in their fields, and overcome the challenges and difficulties that they face. however, hard work alone is not enough to guarantee fame and success. there are other factors that also influence the outcome of their endeavors. the right text will discuss some of these factors in the following paragraph."

      "Outcome2": "The negative impact of online computer games on students' learning outcomes and health is not only reflected in their academic performance, but also in their physical and mental well-being. statistics and evidence from credible sources indicate that online computer games can cause various problems for students, such as addiction, sleep deprivation, obesity, aggression, depression, and even death. for example, according to a report by the world health organization, online gaming disorder is a serious mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide, especially young people, and can lead to impaired functioning, social isolation, and reduced quality of life. moreover, a study by the american academy of pediatrics found that excessive screen time, including online gaming, can increase the risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes among children and adolescents. furthermore, a meta-analysis by the american psychological association revealed that violent online games can increase aggressive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and decrease empathy and prosocial behavior, among players. additionally, a survey by the china youth association for network development showed that online gaming addiction is one of the main causes of suicide among chinese youth, and that many of them suffer from depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. therefore, online computer games pose a serious threat to students' learning outcomes and health, and should be regulated and limited.",
      "Outcome3": "One may argue that online computer games are not entirely detrimental to students' academic performance and well-being, as some of them may benefit from playing these games as a way to pursue their career interests or develop their skills. for instance, some students may aspire to become game designers, programmers, or testers, and playing online games may help them gain insights into the industry and the market. some students may also enhance their cognitive abilities, such as problem-solving, creativity, and coordination, by playing online games that challenge them intellectually and physically.",
      "Outcome4": "Some might argue that online computer games are not entirely detrimental for students, as they might inspire some of them to pursue careers related to computer technology or gaming industry. however, this is a very rare and uncertain outcome, and it does not justify the risk of wasting precious time and energy, jeopardizing academic performance, and endangering physical and mental health. the vast majority of students who indulge in online computer games are not aiming for such professional goals, but rather escaping from the reality and challenges of their studies and life. they are more likely to fall behind in their classes, develop unhealthy habits, and suffer from various negative consequences, such as sleep deprivation, addiction, isolation, aggression, and even death. therefore, the potential benefits of online computer games for a few students are far outweighed by the serious harms they cause for most students.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, it is clear that on-line computer games have a negative impact on the academic performance and health of most students. instead of developing useful skills and knowledge, they waste their precious time and energy on virtual entertainment that can be addictive and harmful. they neglect their studies, their sleep and their physical well-being, which can lead to serious consequences such as failing exams, dropping out of school or even dying from exhaustion.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is evident that on-line computer games have a negative impact on most students' academic performance and health. they not only distract them from their studies, but also deprive them of the necessary rest and physical activity. moreover, they expose them to the risk of addiction, violence, and even death. only a small proportion of students can benefit from their interest in computer games and pursue a related career, but they are the exception rather than the rule."

      "Outcome2": "Following the customs of the new country can also benefit the immigrants in terms of communication and integration. by respecting and practicing the local norms and values, the immigrants can show their appreciation and openness to the host society, and avoid offending or alienating the natives. this can facilitate their social interactions and relationships with the people around them, such as neighbors, colleagues, or friends. moreover, by participating in the cultural activities and events of the new country, the immigrants can enrich their knowledge and experience, and broaden their perspectives and horizons. this can help them overcome the barriers and prejudices that may exist between different groups, and foster a sense of belonging and identity in the new environment.",
      "Outcome3": "Following the customs in the new country can also help the immigrants to communicate and interact with the local people more smoothly and respectfully. different countries have different ways of greeting, dressing, or celebrating, which reflect their values, beliefs, and traditions. for instance, in some asian countries, such as japan or china, bowing is a common way of showing respect and gratitude, while in some western countries, such as the united states or canada, shaking hands or hugging is more acceptable. similarly, in some muslim countries, such as saudi arabia or iran, women are expected to cover their hair and body with a veil or a cloak, while in some european countries, such as france or italy, women can wear more fashionable and revealing clothes. moreover, in some countries, such as india or mexico, there are many festivals and celebrations that are unique and colorful, such as diwali or day of the dead, while in some countries, such as australia or new zealand, there are fewer holidays and more casual activities, such as barbecue or surfing. by following these customs, the immigrants can show their respect and appreciation for the new culture, and also make friends and connections with the local people.",
      "Outcome4": "However, following the customs of the new country may also pose some challenges or drawbacks for the immigrants. for instance, some immigrants may feel that they are losing their own identity or heritage, if they abandon their original customs and traditions. they may struggle to balance their loyalty to their roots and their integration to the new society. moreover, some immigrants may face discrimination or prejudice from the natives, who may view them as outsiders or threats, regardless of how well they conform to the local customs. therefore, the immigrants need to be aware of these potential risks and find ways to cope with them.",
      "Outcome5": "Following the customs of a new country can also benefit the immigrants in other ways. for instance, it can help them communicate better with the local people, who may appreciate their respect and interest in their culture. it can also help them avoid some misunderstandings or conflicts that may arise from different cultural norms or expectations. moreover, it can enrich their own cultural identity and diversity, by exposing them to different perspectives and values. therefore, following the customs of a new country can be a positive and rewarding experience for the immigrants.",
      "Outcome6": "However, following the new customs does not mean that the immigrants have to abandon their own cultural identities. on the contrary, they can also maintain and share their original customs with the local people, which can enrich the cultural diversity and mutual understanding in the new country. for instance, if one celebrated the lunar new year with traditional food and decorations in canada, he or she would not only preserve the heritage of their ancestors, but also introduce a different aspect of asian culture to the canadian society. therefore, the immigrants can balance the respect for the new customs and the preservation of their own customs."

During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game.

      "Outcome2": "Vacations are not only a time for relaxation and enjoyment, but also a crucial factor for students' health and well-being. according to many studies, taking regular breaks from academic pressure can reduce stress, improve mood, enhance creativity, and boost memory and concentration. vacations can also help students to develop their social and emotional skills, as they can interact with their family and friends, explore new places and cultures, and pursue their hobbies and interests. by having a balance between work and play, students can maintain their physical and mental health and prevent burnout and fatigue. therefore, vacations are an essential part of the educational process and should not be seen as a waste of time or a distraction from learning.",
      "Outcome3": "Not only do vacations benefit students' mental and physical health, but they also enhance their academic performance. this is supported by scientific evidence that shows how breaks from school can improve students' learning outcomes.",
      "Outcome4": "The benefits of vacations for students are not only based on personal experiences, but also on empirical evidence. several studies have shown that vacations can improve students' academic performance and motivation by reducing stress, enhancing memory, and stimulating creativity. for example, a 2012 study by the american psychological association found that students who took a week-long vacation during the school year had significantly higher grades and lower levels of anxiety than those who did not. similarly, a 2016 study by the university of helsinki found that students who had longer summer breaks performed better on cognitive tests and reported higher levels of interest and enjoyment in learning than those who had shorter breaks. these findings suggest that vacations can provide students with valuable opportunities to refresh their minds, consolidate their knowledge, and discover new interests.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, it is evident that vacations are essential for students to refresh their minds and bodies, as well as to improve their academic performance. by having breaks from the regular routine of studying, students can relax, enjoy, and explore their interests and hobbies. they can also review their progress and identify their strengths and weaknesses. this way, they can prepare themselves for the next session with more confidence and motivation. moreover, vacations can also help students to develop their social and emotional skills, as they can interact with their family and friends, and learn from different experiences and cultures.",
      "Outcome6": "These benefits of vacations are not only anecdotal, but also backed by scientific evidence. several studies have shown that taking breaks from academic work can boost students' memory, creativity, motivation, and well-being. for example, a 2016 study by the american psychological association found that students who participated in a four-week summer program that involved outdoor activities, arts, and social interactions reported higher levels of happiness, self-esteem, and academic interest than those who stayed at home or attended traditional summer school. moreover, vacations can also help students avoid burnout, stress, and fatigue, which can impair their learning and performance."

      "Outcome2": "One of the consequences of the health gap between poorer and richer nations is the high prevalence of infectious diseases and malnutrition in the former. these health problems are often related to poverty, as many people in poorer nations lack access to clean water, sanitation, adequate food, and preventive health care. for example, malaria, tuberculosis, hiv/aids, and diarrheal diseases are some of the leading causes of death and disability in low-income countries, and they can be prevented or treated with relatively low-cost interventions. however, without enough doctors, nurses, and hospitals, many people in poorer nations do not receive the necessary diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care. firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. high population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. on top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. to solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.",
      "Outcome3": "Another area where richer nations can assist poorer nations is education. education is essential for the development of human capital, social welfare, and economic growth. however, many poorer nations face challenges such as low enrollment rates, high dropout rates, poor quality of instruction, and inadequate infrastructure and resources. these challenges limit the opportunities and potential of millions of children and youth in the world.",
      "Outcome4": "Another area where richer nations can assist poorer nations is education. many poorer nations struggle to provide quality education for their children and youth, due to lack of resources, infrastructure, and qualified teachers. this can limit their opportunities for social and economic development and empowerment. richer nations can support or improve the education system in poorer nations by providing scholarships for students to pursue higher education in their own or foreign countries, by training teachers in pedagogy and curriculum development, or by donating books and equipment to enhance the learning environment. these actions can help poorer nations to achieve their educational goals and improve their human capital.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the most significant ways that richer nations can help poorer nations is by providing support in the field of health care. poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations, which affects their ability to cope with diseases and emergencies. moreover, the high population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning exacerbates the problem of insufficient health facilities and resources. to solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these poorer nations as well as donate money to build hospitals. this would not only improve the health outcomes of the people in need, but also foster goodwill and cooperation between the countries.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main reasons why poorer nations need the assistance of richer nations is the huge gap in the quality and accessibility of health care services. the following paragraphs will explain how this gap affects the lives of millions of people and what can be done to narrow it."

      "Outcome2": "In times of crisis, people need to access accurate and timely information to cope with the situation and make informed decisions. however, paper media such as newspapers and magazines have limitations in delivering the latest news and updates to the readers. they depend on printing and distribution schedules, which can cause delays and outdated information. on the other hand, digital media such as websites, social media, and mobile apps can provide faster and more reliable information than paper media. they can use various sources and formats, such as text, images, videos, and audio, to report the current affairs as quickly as possible. they can also update and correct the information as new facts and evidence emerge. for example, when the aircraft mh 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. the friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. in such situations, newspapers and magazines could not respond as fast as digital media. instead of waiting for next publication, people could get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. this explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.",
      "Outcome3": "Digital media not only provides information faster than newspapers and magazines, but also has the potential to influence public opinion and decision making in different situations. for instance, digital media can create awareness and mobilize people for social causes, such as environmental protection, human rights, or democracy movements. digital media can also expose corruption, injustice, or misconduct by authorities or powerful groups, and demand accountability and transparency. furthermore, digital media can offer diverse perspectives and opinions on various issues, and enable dialogue and debate among citizens and stakeholders. these examples show how digital media can play a vital role in shaping the public sphere and fostering civic engagement.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, media has a crucial role in informing the public about the latest developments in the world, especially during emergencies. paper and magazines cannot compete with digital media in terms of speed and accessibility. people prefer to access reliable and timely information online rather than wait for the next edition of print media. therefore, digital media will rule over paper and magazines in the future.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the advantages of digital media over paper and magazines is its speed and timeliness in reporting the news. a very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. this helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. for example, when the aircraft mh 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. the friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. in such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. this explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines. therefore, digital media has a competitive edge over traditional media in terms of delivering the latest and most relevant information to the audience.",
      "Outcome6": "However, publishing information quickly is not the only factor that determines the popularity and credibility of media. another crucial aspect is how the media presents and analyzes the information in a balanced and objective way. paper and magazines have some advantages over digital media in this regard."

It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.",

In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts."

      "Outcome1": "However, the issue of artistic freedom is not so simple and straightforward. there are also ethical and social implications that need to be considered when artists express their ideas. while some might argue that artists have the right to challenge norms and conventions, others might question the responsibility and accountability of artists towards their audiences and communities. how can we balance the need for creativity and innovation with the respect for diversity and harmony? how can we protect the artistic integrity and autonomy of artists without compromising the public interest and order? these are some of the questions that need to be addressed when dealing with the topic of control over artists' ideas.",
      "Outcome2": "Hence, it is clear that imposing control over artists' ideas has both advantages and disadvantages. on one hand, it can hinder their creativity and innovation, which are essential for producing high-quality and original arts. on the other hand, it can prevent them from crossing the line and offending certain groups or values, which are important for maintaining social harmony and stability. therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between artistic freedom and social responsibility, and to respect the diversity and sensitivity of different cultures and beliefs.",
      "Outcome3": "However, imposing some control over artists' ideas is not necessarily a bad thing, as it can also have some advantages. for instance, by following certain guidelines or standards, artists can ensure that their work is suitable for a wider audience and does not offend or harm anyone. moreover, control can also stimulate artists to challenge themselves and find creative ways to convey their messages within the given constraints. additionally, control can also help to preserve and promote the cultural and moral values of a society, as well as to prevent the misuse or abuse of artistic freedom for personal or political gains. therefore, control can be seen as a form of balance and responsibility for artists.",
      "Outcome4": "However, some might argue that control over artists' ideas is necessary to ensure that they respect the cultural and social values of the society they live in. they might claim that without any supervision or guidance, artists might offend or provoke certain groups or individuals with their works, especially in a diverse and pluralistic society. they might also point out that control can help to maintain the quality and standards of the arts, as well as to protect the public from harmful or inappropriate content. therefore, they might suggest that some form of regulation or censorship is needed to balance the freedom and responsibility of the artists.",
      "Outcome5": "However, some people may argue that giving artists total freedom of expression is not always beneficial for the society. they may point out that there are certain ethical and moral issues that artists should consider before creating their works. they may also claim that some forms of art can offend or provoke certain groups or individuals, and thus cause social unrest or violence.",
      "Outcome6": "However, while it is important to encourage artists' creativity and freedom of expression, it is also necessary to consider the potential impact of their work on the society and the culture they live in. not all forms of art are universally accepted or appreciated, and some might even offend or provoke certain groups or individuals. therefore, some degree of regulation or censorship might be needed to ensure that artists do not cross the line of decency, morality, or legality."

      "Outcome2": "While some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year, others argue that their talents should not be overrated. their careers may have some benefits, such as fame, popularity, and personal satisfaction, but they also face many challenges, such as intense competition, high pressure, and short-lived success. moreover, their careers may expose them to risks of injury, scandal, or exploitation. they also have to deal with the demands and expectations of their fans, sponsors, and media, which may affect their privacy and mental health. therefore, their high salaries may not reflect their actual contributions to the society, but rather the market forces and the public preferences that shape their industry.",
      "Outcome3": "Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. however, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. i believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields. on the other hand, some people argue that the contributions of these celebrities are not only unequal, but also insignificant to the society. they claim that their talents are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms, while other professionals play more vital roles in improving the material and social well-being of the nation.",
      "Outcome4": "Therefore, i argue that the salary level of professional athletes and entertainers is not proportional to their social impact. although they have exceptional skills and talents that can entertain and inspire millions of people, their work does not directly address the pressing issues and challenges that the society faces. unlike scientists, doctors, or policemen, who make significant contributions to the advancement and well-being of the society, their work is mainly focused on providing enjoyment and relaxation, which is less essential and valuable. thus, it is unfair and unreasonable that they earn much more than other professionals who deserve more recognition and reward for their work.",
      "Outcome5": "To support this view, some arguments can be made based on the comparison between the roles and impacts of professional athletes and entertainers and those of other workers in different fields. while the former group of people may have exceptional skills and talents that attract millions of fans and generate huge revenues for the entertainment industry, their work does not directly benefit the society in terms of solving problems, advancing knowledge, or improving living conditions.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, i disagree with the view that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. i think that such a high level of income is not justified by their actual contributions to the society, which are limited and less essential than those of other occupations. in contrast, many people who work in scientific or social, economic fields, who make significant and valuable impacts on the well-being and progress of the society, are often underpaid and undervalued. this creates a huge gap and imbalance between different sectors of the society, which is unfair and unreasonable."

      "Outcome2": "One way to have more kinds of public transportation is to expand the existing networks of buses, trains, subways, and trams, and to make them more accessible, affordable, and reliable. another way is to introduce new modes of transportation that are more environmentally friendly, such as electric vehicles, bike-sharing, or carpooling services. these options can offer more convenience, flexibility, and diversity to the commuters, and reduce the traffic congestion and pollution caused by private cars.",
      "Outcome3": "Public transportation is not only a convenient and affordable way to travel, but also a beneficial solution for reducing environmental problems and energy consumption. lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. also, it provides many advantages. for instance, people can save their expenses from gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. the necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars. moreover, public transportation can help decrease air pollution, traffic congestion, and greenhouse gas emissions, which are harmful for the health and the climate. by choosing public transportation, people can contribute to a cleaner and greener society.",
      "Outcome4": "To sum up, the issue of traffic congestion and pollution is a serious one that requires urgent and effective solutions. increasing the number of public transportation options is a feasible and beneficial way to address this problem, as it can reduce the demand for private vehicles and their negative impacts on the environment and the economy. by choosing to use public transportation, people can not only save money and energy, but also contribute to a more sustainable and livable society.",
      "Outcome5": "These benefits of public transportation are not only beneficial for individuals, but also for the environment and the society. by reducing the use of private cars, public transportation can help lower the emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants, which contribute to global warming and health problems. moreover, public transportation can ease the traffic congestion and improve the mobility and accessibility of people, especially those who live in remote areas or have low incomes. therefore, public transportation can enhance the quality of life and the social equity of the communities.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, promoting public transportation is not only beneficial for the individual commuters, but also for the environment and the society. by reducing the traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, public transportation can enhance the quality of life and health of the urban population. moreover, public transportation can create more job opportunities, support local businesses, and foster social interaction and inclusion."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "One of the main reasons why i favor spending money on improving facilities over hiring famous teachers is that facilities have a direct impact on the quality of education and the well-being of students. facilities, such as libraries, laboratories, sports centers, and dormitories, provide students with the necessary resources, opportunities, and environments to learn, practice, explore, and socialize. these facilities can stimulate students' curiosity, creativity, and motivation, as well as enhance their physical and mental health. on the other hand, hiring famous teachers does not necessarily guarantee that they are effective, engaging, or compatible with the students' needs, interests, and backgrounds. famous teachers may have high academic credentials and reputations, but they may also have high expectations, rigid methods, or limited availability. therefore, i believe that improving facilities is more conducive to students than hiring famous teachers.",
      "Outcome2": "In addition to the benefits of better facilities for the school's reputation and competitiveness, there are also direct impacts on students' learning outcomes and satisfaction. for instance, by having access to modern laboratories, libraries, and equipment, students can conduct more advanced and diverse experiments, research, and projects, which can enrich their knowledge, skills, and creativity. furthermore, by having comfortable and spacious classrooms, dormitories, and cafeterias, students can enjoy a more conducive and pleasant learning environment, which can reduce their stress, enhance their motivation, and foster their social interactions. therefore, by spending money on improving facilities, schools can not only attract more students, but also improve their academic performance and well-being.",
      "Outcome3": "However, some may argue that hiring famous teachers is more beneficial for students' academic achievement and future prospects. they may claim that famous teachers have more expertise, reputation, and connections in their fields, and that they can inspire and motivate students to pursue their goals. they may also point out that famous teachers can attract more students and funding to the school, enhancing its prestige and competitiveness. while these points are not without merit, they do not outweigh the advantages of improving facilities for several reasons. first, famous teachers are not necessarily good teachers, as they may lack pedagogical skills, empathy, or availability for their students. second, famous teachers are not always affordable or accessible for schools, especially for those in remote or disadvantaged areas. third, famous teachers are not the only source of learning and inspiration for students, as they can also benefit from other resources, such as libraries, laboratories, or online platforms. therefore, hiring famous teachers is not a sufficient or sustainable strategy for improving education quality.",
      "Outcome4": "To sum up, i have argued that universities should spend money on improving facilities rather than hiring famous teachers, because facilities can enhance students' learning outcomes, motivation, and well-being. i have supported my claim with evidence from academic research, personal experience, and hypothetical scenarios. i believe that improving facilities is a more effective and sustainable way to foster a high-quality education for students, who are the main stakeholders of the university. therefore, i strongly advocate that schools should prioritize facilities over teachers in their budget allocation.",
      "Outcome5": "In order to support my preference for spending money on improving facilities, i would like to present some reasons and examples. first of all, i think that improving facilities can enhance the quality of education and learning environment for students. for instance, if schools have modern and well-equipped laboratories, libraries, and computer centers, students can access more resources and conduct more experiments and researches. these facilities can stimulate students' curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking skills, which are essential for their academic and professional development. furthermore, improving facilities can also benefit the teachers, as they can use more advanced and diverse methods and tools to deliver their lectures and interact with their students. therefore, improving facilities can improve both the input and output of the educational process.",
      "Outcome6": "In order to support my viewpoint, i would like to present some reasons and examples. first of all, i think that improving facilities can benefit students in various aspects, such as enhancing their learning environment, stimulating their creativity, and satisfying their diverse needs. for instance, a well-equipped library can provide students with abundant resources and information, a modern laboratory can enable students to conduct experiments and explore scientific phenomena, and a comfortable dormitory can offer students a cozy and safe place to rest and socialize. these facilities can not only facilitate students' academic performance, but also enrich their campus life and cultivate their holistic development."

      "Left": "There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.",
      "Right": "Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks."

    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "In this essay, i will argue that successful people usually do not take risks or try new things, but rather rely on their existing knowledge and skills to achieve their goals. i will support this claim by providing two main reasons: firstly, taking risks or trying new things often involves uncertainty and unpredictability, which can hinder one's performance and outcome; and secondly, one's capability and talent are more important factors than one's willingness to experiment or challenge oneself. in the following paragraphs, i will elaborate on these reasons and illustrate them with relevant examples.",
      "Outcome2": "To illustrate my point that successful people still do things they already know, i would like to draw some examples from different fields of human endeavor. for example, in the business world, many successful entrepreneurs and innovators are not those who constantly venture into unknown territories, but those who apply their existing knowledge and skills to create value and solve problems. steve jobs, for instance, did not invent the personal computer, the smartphone, or the tablet, but he used his design and marketing expertise to revolutionize these products and industries. similarly, in the artistic field, many successful writers, musicians, and painters are not those who experiment with radical forms and styles, but those who master their craft and express their unique vision and voice. j.k. rowling, for example, did not invent the fantasy genre, but she used her storytelling and imagination to create the harry potter series, which captivated millions of readers around the world. thus, from these examples, we can see that successful people still do things they already know, but they do them in excellent and creative ways.",
      "Outcome3": "However, some people may argue that taking risks or trying new things is essential for success, as it can help them to discover new opportunities, overcome challenges, and innovate. they may cite examples of entrepreneurs, inventors, or explorers who achieved remarkable feats by venturing into the unknown and breaking the norms. they may claim that doing things they already know can limit their potential and make them complacent or stagnant.",
      "Outcome4": "However, some might argue that taking risks or trying new things is essential for success, because it can help people discover new opportunities, challenge themselves, and innovate. they might cite examples of entrepreneurs, inventors, or explorers who achieved great things by venturing into the unknown and overcoming difficulties. they might also claim that doing things one already knows can lead to stagnation, boredom, or complacency, and that success requires constant learning and adaptation.",
      "Outcome5": "In addition to the above argument, one might also consider the role of experience and expertise in achieving success. successful people usually have a deep and comprehensive knowledge of their fields, which enables them to apply their skills and strategies effectively and efficiently. doing things they already know allows them to maximize their strengths and avoid unnecessary mistakes. therefore, they do not need to take risks or try new things that might jeopardize their performance or reputation. instead, they can focus on improving their existing skills and expanding their knowledge through continuous learning and practice.",
      "Outcome6": "In addition to the argument that successful people still do things they already know, another reason to support this view is that taking risks or trying new things does not guarantee success, but rather exposes one to potential failures and challenges. in fact, success often requires not only innovation and creativity, but also mastery and competence in one's field of expertise. therefore, instead of venturing into unknown territories or experimenting with unproven methods, successful people tend to focus on honing their skills and improving their performance in what they are good at. this can be illustrated by the following example."

      "Outcome2": "Technology not only influences the way people make and consume food from different cultures, but also affects other aspects of culture, such as language, communication, and education. technology enables people to learn new languages, access diverse information, and interact with people from different backgrounds and perspectives. for instance, people can use online platforms, apps, and devices to learn foreign languages, watch movies and shows, read books and articles, and listen to podcasts and music from various cultures. they can also communicate with people from different countries and regions through social media, video calls, and online forums. moreover, technology enhances the quality and accessibility of education, as people can enroll in online courses, use digital tools and resources, and collaborate with teachers and peers from different locations and disciplines. therefore, technology plays a significant role in shaping and changing the cultural landscape of the world.",
      "Outcome3": "Therefore, technology has a significant impact on the diversity of food cultures in the world. by using the internet, people can access a vast amount of information and resources about different cuisines and cooking techniques. they can also share their own recipes and experiences with other food enthusiasts online. this facilitates the exchange and fusion of culinary traditions and innovations across borders and regions. according to a survey by statista, 71% of canadians and 66% of americans use online sources to find new recipes, while 44% of canadians and 37% of americans use them to learn about foreign cuisines. moreover, technology also enables people to enjoy a variety of foods from different cultures in their local restaurants, as i observed in my recent visit to a canadian restaurant. this shows how technology enriches and expands the food choices and preferences of people in different countries.",
      "Outcome4": "While technology can influence many aspects of culture, such as communication, education, and entertainment, some people might argue that there are some domains that are more immune to its effects, such as food, art, and religion. these people might claim that these cultural expressions are unique to each group and reflect their identity, history, and values. they might also suggest that technology cannot capture the nuances, flavors, and meanings of these forms of creativity and spirituality. this point has some merits on the surface; however, it overlooks the fact that technology can also facilitate the exchange, adaptation, and innovation of these cultural aspects. many countries, such as canada, the usa, and britain, have many restaurants that serve foods from different countries and cultures. in fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the internet. for example, two days ago, i went to a canadian restaurant and i ate noodles, sushi, which are chinese foods, and greek salad.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, the claim that technology cannot affect some aspects of culture such as making foods is not convincing. technology has enabled people to access and share information about different cuisines and ingredients from around the world. as a result, many restaurants and individuals can offer and enjoy a variety of dishes from different cultures. this shows that technology has a significant impact on the diversity and fusion of food cultures.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is clear that technology has a significant impact on the diversity and preservation of cultures, especially in the aspect of food. while some people might argue that making foods is a unique cultural expression that technology cannot affect, the reality is that technology enables people to access and experiment with foods from different countries and cultures. this can have both positive and negative consequences, depending on how people use and appreciate the cultural diversity of foods."

      "Outcome1": "Celebrities are often admired and idolized by children, who look up to them as role models and sources of inspiration. however, the media portrayal of celebrities may not always reflect the reality of their lives, and may create unrealistic and distorted images of success and happiness. how does this affect the values and expectations that children develop in life? one possible consequence is that children may underestimate the importance of hard work and education, and overestimate the benefits of fame and wealth. the left text and the right text illustrate this point with an example.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the sources of the celebrities' influence on children is the media, which often glamorizes their lifestyles and achievements, or exposes their controversies and problems. for example, children may admire celebrities who are known for their lavish spending, glamorous fashion, or extravagant parties, such as kim kardashian, paris hilton, or kylie jenner. they may also be fascinated by celebrities who are involved in scandals, such as justin bieber, britney spears, or lindsay lohan. these examples may give children the impression that success and happiness are measured by money, fame, or popularity, rather than by hard work, talent, or character. they may also make children think that celebrities can get away with anything, or that their problems are not serious or can be easily solved.",
      "Outcome3": "However, not all celebrities are bad role models for children. fortunately, there are also some famous people who use their fame and influence to promote positive values and causes, such as education, charity, environmental protection, and social justice. these celebrities can inspire children to pursue their dreams and passions, while also being responsible and compassionate citizens. on the other hand, parents and educators can also play a vital role in helping children develop critical thinking and media literacy skills, so that they can distinguish between reality and fantasy, and evaluate the messages and images they see in the media. by doing so, they can prevent children from being misled or manipulated by the unrealistic and harmful representations of celebrities.",
      "Outcome4": "However, this impression of the celebrities is often distorted and misleading, as many of them have to face intense competition, criticism, and pressure in their fields, and some may also struggle with personal issues, such as addiction, mental health, or family problems. therefore, it is important that parents, teachers, and media can help children develop more realistic and positive values and expectations in life, and not base their self-worth and goals on fame and fortune alone. for example, parents can encourage their children to pursue their passions and talents, but also teach them the value of hard work, resilience, and responsibility. teachers can expose their children to a variety of role models and careers, and help them develop critical thinking and media literacy skills to evaluate the information and messages they receive. media can also play a positive role by featuring more diverse and inspiring stories of people who have made a difference in their communities and the world, and who have overcome challenges and adversity with courage and integrity. by doing so, they can help children appreciate the diversity and complexity of human experiences, and foster their curiosity, empathy, and social awareness.",
      "Outcome5": "However, this impression of the celebrities is often misleading and unrealistic. the left text does not consider the challenges and difficulties that many celebrities face in their profession, such as intense competition, public scrutiny, pressure to maintain their image and reputation, and the risk of losing their popularity and income. the right text also ignores the positive aspects of celebrities, such as their talents, skills, creativity, dedication, and social influence. some celebrities use their fame and wealth to support various causes and charities, to inspire and educate their fans, and to contribute to the society and culture. therefore, children should not blindly idolize or imitate celebrities, but rather learn from their strengths and weaknesses, and develop their own goals and values.",
      "Outcome6": "However, this impression is often misleading and harmful for children's development. celebrities may appear to have glamorous and easy lives, but they also face many challenges and pressures that are not always visible to the public. they have to deal with intense competition, high expectations, media scrutiny, and personal issues. many of them have worked hard to achieve their fame and success, and some of them have also used their influence to support various causes and charities. therefore, children should not idolize celebrities blindly, but rather learn from their positive qualities and achievements, as well as their mistakes and struggles."

      "Outcome2": "Judging people by their appearance is a common practice that many of us do unconsciously or consciously, based on our stereotypes, biases, or preferences. however, this practice can have negative consequences for both the judge and the judged, as it can lead to misunderstanding, discrimination, or missed opportunities. sometimes, we might form an impression of someone based on their skin color, body shape, facial expression, or clothing, without knowing anything about their personality, character, or values. this impression might not reflect the reality of who they are or what they can offer. second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. for instance, i have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and i had always panicked of her. one day in a cold winter while i was getting back to home from school i realized that i lost my keys, so i could not do anything before my parents getting back home. she asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. after that i understood, i had to never judge with people's appearance.",
      "Outcome3": "This example shows how judging people by their appearance can be misleading and unfair. i had assumed that my neighbor was a mean and scary person just because of her skin color, weight and facial expression. however, when i needed her help, she was kind and generous to me. she offered me a warm place to stay, food and drinks, and friendly conversation. she treated me like a friend, not a stranger. from this experience, i learned that i should not judge people by their appearance, but by their character and actions. i realized that appearances can hide the true personality and values of a person.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, judging people by their appearance can lead to unfair and inaccurate assumptions that can harm our relationships and ourselves. we might miss out on valuable opportunities to learn from and connect with others who have different backgrounds, cultures, and personalities than us. moreover, we might hurt the feelings of those who are already facing discrimination and prejudice because of their looks. therefore, we should try to be more open-minded and respectful of people's diversity and individuality. we can do this by getting to know them better, listening to their stories, and finding common interests and values. we can also challenge our own stereotypes and biases and recognize that appearance is not a reliable indicator of someone's character, intelligence, or worth. by doing so, we can enrich our lives and promote a more inclusive and harmonious society.",
      "Outcome5": "However, judging people by their appearance can be misleading and unfair, as it does not reflect their true personality and character. for example, i once had a neighbor who was old, black-skinned and frowning and i had always been afraid of her. but when i lost my keys one winter day and she invited me to stay with her until my parents came home, i realized how kind and hospitable she was. this experience taught me not to judge people by their looks.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is clear that judging people by their appearance can be misleading and unfair. we might miss the opportunity to get to know someone's personality, character and values if we only focus on their external features. moreover, we might hurt or offend someone who does not fit our stereotypes or expectations of beauty. instead, we should try to be more open-minded and respectful of the diversity and uniqueness of human beings. a good example of how this can benefit us is the following story."

      "Outcome2": "Therefore, economic issues should not be used as an excuse to neglect environmental issues, as they are both global and critical for human survival and well-being. economic issues are not necessarily incompatible with environmental issues, as there are ways to achieve sustainable development that respect the natural resources and ecosystems that support life on earth. moreover, ignoring environmental issues would only worsen the economic situation in the long run, as the costs of adapting to or mitigating the impacts of climate change and environmental degradation would be much higher than the benefits of short-term growth. thus, economic and environmental issues should be addressed together, with a balanced and holistic approach that considers the interdependence and complexity of both domains.",
      "Outcome3": "One might acknowledge that economic issues are indeed global and critical, and that they affect people's livelihoods and well-being in various ways. however, this does not mean that environmental issues can be put aside or neglected, as they are also global and critical, and they have direct and indirect impacts on the economy and society. refuting the analogy of environmental problems being like chronic diseases, one could argue that they are more like ticking time bombs that could explode at any moment, causing irreversible harm and devastation. furthermore, one could point out that many economic activities and developments are unsustainable and harmful to the environment, and that they create vicious cycles of degradation and depletion. therefore, one could conclude that addressing environmental issues is not only a moral duty, but also a strategic necessity for ensuring long-term economic stability and prosperity.",
      "Outcome4": "Therefore, economic issues and environmental issues are not mutually exclusive, but rather interrelated and interdependent. economic activities that disregard environmental sustainability will only lead to more ecological disasters and social unrest in the long run, while environmental protection and restoration can also create new opportunities and benefits for the economy and society. we need to balance our economic goals with our environmental responsibilities, and adopt a holistic and proactive approach to address both challenges. ignoring or postponing environmental issues is not an option, as they are already affecting our lives and livelihoods in profound and irreversible ways.",
      "Outcome5": "However, this argument overlooks the fact that economic and environmental issues are not separate or contradictory, but rather interdependent and mutually reinforcing. a healthy and sustainable environment is essential for economic growth and human well-being, as it provides natural resources, ecosystem services, and resilience to natural disasters. conversely, a deteriorating and unstable environment poses serious risks and costs for the economy and society, as it leads to resource depletion, pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate change impacts. therefore, it is not a matter of choosing between economic and environmental priorities, but rather of integrating them and finding solutions that can benefit both.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is clear that economic issues and environmental issues are not separate or mutually exclusive, but rather interrelated and interdependent. ignoring or neglecting one aspect would have negative consequences for the other, and for the well-being of humanity and the planet. we need to find a balance between economic growth and environmental protection, and adopt more sustainable and responsible ways of producing and consuming. otherwise, we might face even more severe and irreversible environmental disasters in the future, which would also undermine our economic stability and social justice."

      "Outcome1": "One of the major challenges that workers face in the modern economy is the threat of technological unemployment, which refers to the loss of jobs due to the introduction of new technologies that can perform tasks more efficiently or cheaply than human labor. technological unemployment can affect various sectors of the economy, such as clerical, service, retail, and manufacturing, where machines, automation, and software can replace or reduce the need for human workers. this can have negative consequences for the workers who lose their jobs, as well as for the overall income distribution and social stability of the society. therefore, many workers seek to diversify their income sources by working on different sectors, or by acquiring new skills and education that can make them more adaptable and competitive in the changing labor market.",
      "Outcome2": "This trend of technological unemployment is not only affecting the united states, but also other developed and developing countries. according to a report by the world economic forum, by 2025, machines will perform more tasks than humans in the workplace, displacing 85 million jobs across 15 industries and 26 economies. however, the same report also predicts that 97 million new roles may emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labor between humans and machines. therefore, workers need to constantly update their skills and competencies to remain competitive and employable in the changing labor market. the best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. last but not least, corporational policy to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.",
      "Outcome3": "To sum up, the trend of working on multiple jobs is not a matter of choice, but a necessity for many workers in the current economic situation. they face various challenges such as the rising cost of living, the lack of job security, the impact of technology, and the low wages offered by some employers. these factors force them to seek additional income sources and diversify their skills and experiences. however, this also entails some drawbacks such as stress, fatigue, burnout, and reduced quality of life. therefore, in the following paragraph, i will discuss some possible solutions and recommendations to address this issue and improve the working conditions and well-being of the multi-jobbers.",
      "Outcome4": "To sum up, the changing nature of work in the modern world has led many workers to seek multiple jobs as a way of coping with the challenges of economic instability, technological unemployment, and low wages. this phenomenon of multiple job holding has both advantages and disadvantages, depending on the individual's circumstances, preferences, and goals. however, it also raises some important questions about the future of work, such as how to ensure decent working conditions, fair compensation, and social protection for workers who juggle multiple roles and responsibilities. moreover, it challenges the traditional notions of career development, skill acquisition, and work-life balance, and calls for new policies and practices that can support workers' well-being, productivity, and adaptability in a dynamic and uncertain labor market.",
      "Outcome5": "The factors that cause people to work on multiple jobs are not only related to the changing nature of work, but also to the impact of technology and the wage gap. moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role in promoting further unemployment. the official term of it is named \"technological unemployment\". north american economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent american economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. for example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. the best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. however, this is not always easy or rewarding, as many workers face the challenge of low wages and unequal pay. last but not least, corporational policy to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors. by doing so, they hope to supplement their income and improve their living standards, but they also risk overwork, stress and burnout.",
      "Outcome6": "However, finding a stable and well-paid job is becoming increasingly difficult for many workers in the current economy. as the competition for employment intensifies, some of the factors that contribute to this challenge are globalization, technological unemployment, and corporate policies. these factors force many workers to look for alternative or additional sources of income in different sectors."

      "Outcome2": "However, despite the remarkable progress that women have made in various aspects of life, there are still many obstacles and challenges that hinder their full participation and empowerment. gender discrimination, stereotypes, violence, and unequal opportunities are some of the issues that women face in different contexts and cultures. therefore, it is not enough to merely acknowledge the importance of gender fairness, but also to take concrete actions and measures to promote it and protect it from any threats.",
      "Outcome3": "However, despite the remarkable achievements and contributions of women in various domains, they still face many obstacles or barriers that prevent them from having equal opportunities or rights as men in different aspects of life. for instance, women often encounter gender discrimination and stereotypes in the workplace, such as lower wages, fewer promotions, sexual harassment, and lack of support or mentoring. moreover, women may also suffer from the double burden of balancing work and family responsibilities, especially when they have to deal with inadequate childcare, inflexible working hours, or unsupportive partners. furthermore, women may also face challenges in accessing education, health care, legal protection, or political participation, due to factors such as poverty, violence, cultural norms, or social exclusion. these factors not only limit the potential and well-being of women, but also hinder the progress and development of the whole society.",
      "Outcome4": "However, despite the remarkable achievements of women in various domains, the gender gap still persists in many aspects of social and economic life. for instance, women often face discrimination, harassment, and violence in the workplace, education, and health care. to overcome or reduce this gap, it is essential to raise awareness and education about gender equality and human rights, to enforce laws and policies that protect and empower women, and to support women's participation and leadership in all sectors and levels of decision-making.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, it is unreasonable and unjust to discriminate against women or deny them equal opportunities in any aspect of life. whether it is education, employment, health care, politics, or culture, women deserve to have the same access and benefits as men. moreover, promoting gender equality is not only a matter of human rights, but also a source of social and economic progress. by empowering women and enhancing their participation and leadership, society can benefit from their talents, insights, and perspectives.",
      "Outcome6": "However, despite the remarkable achievements of women in various domains, there are still some challenges and obstacles that hinder their full participation and empowerment. gender discrimination, stereotypes, sexual harassment, unequal pay and lack of support are some of the issues that many women face in their careers and lives. therefore, it is essential to promote gender equality and justice in all aspects of society, and to ensure that women have equal access to opportunities, resources and rights as men."

      "Outcome1": "Television is one of the most popular and influential forms of media in the modern world. it offers a variety of entertainment and information programs that can appeal to different tastes and preferences. however, television also has some negative effects on people's social skills, especially when they watch it too much. in this essay, i will discuss how excessive television viewing can lead to isolation, lack of communication, and reduced empathy among people. first of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.",
      "Outcome2": "The influence of television on people's lives has been a topic of debate for decades. some people argue that television is a source of entertainment, information, and education that can enrich one's knowledge and skills. however, others contend that television is a harmful distraction that can impair one's physical, mental, and social well-being. in this essay, i will support the latter view and demonstrate how television can cause people to become isolated, passive, and violent. first of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the negative effects of television on social skills is that it reduces the opportunities for face-to-face communication and interaction. television can be so captivating and entertaining that people, especially children, may prefer to watch it rather than to talk to their family members, classmates, or neighbors. this can lead to a lack of social skills development, such as listening, empathy, and cooperation, which are essential for building and maintaining relationships.",
      "Outcome4": "First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying. this can have negative effects on their social and academic development, as well as their mental and physical health. according to a study by the american academy of pediatrics, children who watch more than four hours of television per day are more likely to be overweight, have lower grades, and exhibit aggressive behavior than those who watch less. moreover, watching too much television can reduce the quality and quantity of communication and interaction with family members, which can weaken the bonds and values that are essential for a healthy and happy family life. therefore, watching television too much can be harmful for children's well-being and relationships.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the negative effects of watching television too much is that it can lead to social isolation. first of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying. moreover, watching television too much can also affect the communication and interaction within families. parents and children may spend less time talking to each other, sharing their feelings and opinions, or doing things together. instead, they may become passive and distracted by the screen, losing the opportunity to bond and support each other. therefore, watching television too much can harm the social relationships of both children and adults.",
      "Outcome6": "This isolation caused by excessive television viewing can have negative effects on people's mental and physical health. for instance, children who are detached from their peers may experience loneliness, depression, or low self-esteem. they may also miss out on the benefits of social interaction, such as developing communication skills, empathy, and cooperation. moreover, spending too much time in front of the screen can lead to physical problems such as obesity, eye strain, or poor posture."

      "Outcome2": "However, modern communication technologies are not without some drawbacks, as some critics have argued. one of the negative effects of these technologies is that they may create social isolation and reduce face-to-face interactions among people. for example, some studies have shown that excessive use of mobile phones and internet chat programs can reduce the quality and quantity of social relationships and lead to loneliness and depression. another issue is that these technologies may pose threats to personal privacy and security, as they expose users to the risk of hacking, identity theft and online fraud. moreover, these technologies may also facilitate cyberbullying, which is the use of electronic means to harass, intimidate or harm others. cyberbullying can have serious consequences for the victims, such as low self-esteem, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. therefore, these technologies require careful and responsible use to avoid their potential harms.",
      "Outcome3": "However, not everyone agrees that modern communication technologies have had a positive impact on our lives. some critics argue that these innovations have created a digital divide between the rich and the poor, and have increased social and economic inequalities. they further point out that the widespread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. anyone who aims to use these innovations has to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to benefit from modern communication technologies.",
      "Outcome4": "In summary, modern communication technologies have enabled people to communicate more easily, quickly and conveniently across distances and time zones, enhancing their personal and professional relationships, as well as their access to information and opportunities. i strongly believe that these advantages outweigh the disadvantages and that most people in the world have gained from these innovations. however, not everyone agrees with this view and some argue that modern communication technologies are not equally accessible or affordable for all segments of society.",
      "Outcome5": "While acknowledging the positive impacts of modern communication technologies, some critics argue that they also entail social and economic inequalities. they contend that not everyone has equal access to these technologies and that they require significant financial resources to acquire and maintain. therefore, they suggest that modern communication technologies widen the gap between the rich and the poor and create a digital divide that excludes and marginalizes the less fortunate.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main arguments in favor of modern communication technologies is that they have enabled people to communicate more easily and quickly across long distances and different cultures. supporters of this view claim that these tools have facilitated social, educational and professional opportunities for many people, especially those who live in remote or isolated areas. they also argue that modern communication technologies have enhanced the access and exchange of information and knowledge, which can foster creativity, innovation and development."

      "Left": "The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.",
      "Right": "Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Internet and computer can also help children develop various skills that are essential for their personal and professional growth. for instance, by using internet and computer, children can enhance their creativity by exploring different forms of expression, such as writing, drawing, designing, composing, etc. they can also improve their communication skills by interacting with other people from different backgrounds, cultures and perspectives, and by learning different languages and modes of communication. moreover, they can boost their problem-solving skills by facing different challenges and puzzles, by finding relevant information and solutions, and by applying their logical and critical thinking. these skills can help children become more confident, adaptable and innovative in their future endeavors.",
      "Outcome2": "Besides accessing information from the internet, children can also use various online platforms or tools to enhance their learning and creativity. for instance, they can use educational games, quizzes, simulations, or puzzles to reinforce their concepts and skills in a fun and interactive way. they can also use online tools to create their own digital content, such as blogs, podcasts, videos, or animations, and share them with others. these activities can foster their critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and problem-solving abilities, which are essential for their future success. by using computers, children can explore their interests and talents in a wide range of domains and express themselves in different ways.",
      "Outcome3": "Therefore, computer and internet can be seen as valuable tools for children's education and skills development. they can enhance children's creativity, problem-solving, communication, and research abilities by providing them with various opportunities and resources. they can also help children to explore their interests, passions, and talents in different fields and domains. computer and internet can make learning more engaging, interactive, and fun for children, as well as broaden their horizons and perspectives.",
      "Outcome4": "However, computer and internet are not without drawbacks for children. some critics may argue that excessive exposure to computer and internet can have some negative effects on children's health and behavior. for instance, spending too much time in front of the screen can cause eye strain, headache, and sleep problems. moreover, some children may become addicted to online games, social media, or inappropriate content, which can affect their academic performance, social skills, and moral values. therefore, children need to be supervised and regulated by their parents and teachers when using computer and internet.",
      "Outcome5": "Besides enhancing their academic performance and developing their talents, computer also offers children a platform to communicate and collaborate with others who share their interests or goals. through various online tools and applications, children can interact with their peers, teachers, mentors, or experts from different fields and cultures, and learn from their experiences and feedback. they can also participate in various online communities, projects, or competitions that challenge their creativity and problem-solving skills. computer thus helps children to broaden their horizons and prepare themselves for the globalized and digitalized world. however, as the right text suggests, computer also has its drawbacks and risks, and children need proper guidance and supervision from their parents to use it wisely and safely.",
      "Outcome6": "However, the benefits of computer for children are not without some drawbacks and challenges. children may also encounter harmful or inappropriate content on the internet, such as violence, pornography, cyberbullying, or scams. they may also spend too much time on the computer, neglecting their physical, social, and emotional development. they may also develop bad habits, such as plagiarism, addiction, or isolation. therefore, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled."

      "Outcome1": "The ageing population of many countries poses a serious challenge to the economic and social development, especially when senior workers dominate the working sector. one of the major disadvantages of this situation is that it reduces the job opportunities for the fresh graduates, who have to face fierce competition and mismatched expectations. first and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. as a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. to illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. on top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.",
      "Outcome2": "This situation of senior workers dominating the working sector can have adverse effects on the economy and the social welfare of the country. firstly, it can reduce the innovation and productivity of the workforce, as the fresh graduates who have the latest skills and knowledge are sidelined or underutilized. secondly, it can increase the fiscal burden of the government, as the aging workers will require more pensions, health care, and social services, while the tax revenue from the younger workers will decline. thirdly, it can create social discontent and frustration among the fresh graduates, who may feel that their talents and aspirations are wasted or ignored. this can lead to brain drain, social unrest, or mental health problems among the younger generation. therefore, it is vital to ensure a balanced and fair distribution of job opportunities among the workers of different ages.",
      "Outcome3": "The negative impacts of senior workers dominating the working sector are not only felt by the fresh graduates, but also by the economy and the society as a whole. according to a report by the world bank, the aging workforce can reduce the productivity, innovation and competitiveness of the economy, as well as increase the fiscal burden of pensions and health care. moreover, the mismatch between the skills and qualifications of the young workers and the available jobs can lead to underemployment, dissatisfaction and frustration among them, which can in turn affect their mental health, social cohesion and civic participation. therefore, it is vital to create a balanced and inclusive labor market that can accommodate the needs and aspirations of both the senior and the junior workers. first and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. as a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. to illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. on top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.",

      "Outcome5": "This situation poses a serious threat to the development of the nation as well as the individual aspirations of the young generation. if the senior workers do not retire at the appropriate age, they will not only occupy the positions that could be filled by the fresh graduates, but also hinder the transfer of knowledge and skills that are essential for innovation and progress. moreover, the fresh graduates who are forced to take up careers that do not match their qualifications and interests will face a lot of frustration and dissatisfaction, which could affect their mental and physical health, as well as their productivity and motivation. therefore, it is imperative to strike a balance between the needs and rights of the senior workers and the fresh graduates, and to create more job opportunities and incentives for both groups.",

      "Outcome1": "However, playing computer games is not a waste of time as some people may think. on the contrary, it can have many benefits for children's cognitive, social, and emotional development. for example, playing computer games can enhance children's problem-solving skills, creativity, and spatial awareness, as they have to overcome challenges, explore virtual environments, and manipulate objects in different ways. moreover, playing computer games can foster children's communication, collaboration, and empathy, as they can interact with other players, share their experiences, and understand different perspectives. furthermore, playing computer games can provide children with a source of entertainment, relaxation, and motivation, as they can enjoy the fun, excitement, and satisfaction of playing. therefore, playing computer games can be a valuable and meaningful activity for children, as long as it is done in moderation and with parental guidance.",
      "Outcome2": "Contrary to the negative view that playing computer games is a waste of time, i believe that playing computer games can benefit children in terms of cognitive, social, and emotional development. first of all, playing computer games can enhance children's cognitive skills, such as problem-solving, memory, attention, creativity, and spatial reasoning. many computer games require children to think strategically, plan ahead, remember information, and apply logic to overcome challenges and achieve goals. these skills are essential for academic success and future careers. moreover, playing computer games can foster children's social skills, such as communication, collaboration, empathy, and leadership. many computer games involve interacting with other players, either online or offline, and require children to cooperate, negotiate, share, and support each other. these skills are vital for building positive relationships and social networks. furthermore, playing computer games can support children's emotional development, such as self-esteem, motivation, resilience, and mood regulation. playing computer games can provide children with a sense of achievement, enjoyment, and satisfaction, as well as opportunities to express themselves, explore their interests, and cope with stress and frustration. these factors can enhance children's mental health and well-being.",
      "Outcome3": "It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a waste of time. i hold a positive view against this opinion. some people may argue that playing computer games can be harmful or distracting for children, as they may expose them to inappropriate or violent content, or reduce their attention span and academic performance. however, i disagree with this view for several reasons. first, playing computer games can have many benefits for children, such as enhancing their cognitive, creative, and social skills, as well as providing them with entertainment and relaxation. second, not all computer games are based on war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects. there are many educational, artistic, and constructive games that can stimulate children's curiosity, imagination, and problem-solving abilities. third, children can play computer games in moderation and with parental guidance, so that they can balance their time and interests with other activities and responsibilities. therefore, time on this activity is not really time wasting, but rather a valuable and enjoyable part of children's development.",
      "Outcome4": "In conclusion, i disagree with the idea that children should not be allowed to play computer games, as i believe that playing computer games can have some benefits for their development, such as improving their creativity, problem-solving skills, and social interaction. playing computer games is not a waste of time, as long as it is done in moderation and with parental guidance. on the other hand, i acknowledge that some computer games can have negative impacts on children, especially those that use inappropriate or harmful themes, such as war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects. these games can expose children to unsuitable content, influence their values and behaviors, and harm their physical and mental health. therefore, i suggest that parents and educators should monitor and regulate the types and amount of computer games that children play, and encourage them to balance their gaming time with other activities, such as reading, sports, and hobbies. by doing so, children can enjoy the fun and advantages of computer games, while avoiding the risks and drawbacks.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the main arguments for the negative view is that playing computer games is a waste of time because it distracts children from more important and beneficial activities. some people believe that children should spend more time on studying, reading, exercising, or socializing with their peers and family, rather than wasting hours on the screen. they claim that playing computer games reduces the children's attention span, academic performance, physical health, and social skills. moreover, they contend that children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting.",
      "Outcome6": "However, some people argue that children should not be allowed to play computer games at all, because they have many negative impacts on their development and education. they present two main reasons to support their claim, which i will examine and refute in the following paragraphs."

      "Outcome2": "Not only has technology improved the field of transportation, but it has also enhanced the entertainment options for people. nowadays, people can enjoy various online games, streaming services, and virtual reality devices that offer them fun and excitement. online games allow people to interact with others from different countries and cultures, while streaming services provide them with access to a wide range of movies, shows, and music. virtual reality, on the other hand, creates immersive and realistic experiences that can stimulate the senses and emotions. these forms of entertainment have enriched people's leisure time and expanded their horizons.",

      "Outcome4": "However, technology also has its negative impacts on human society and the natural environment. for example, the excessive use of automobiles and planes contributes to the emission of greenhouse gases, which cause global warming and climate change. moreover, the dependence on technology exposes people to the risks of cybercrime, such as identity theft, hacking, and phishing. furthermore, technology can also reduce the quality of human interactions and relationships, as people may spend more time online than face-to-face, leading to social isolation and loneliness. therefore, technology is not always a blessing, but also a challenge that requires careful and responsible use.",
      "Outcome5": "However, the convenience of modern transportation also comes with some drawbacks. for one thing, the increasing number of cars on the road contributes to the air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, which have negative impacts on the environment and human health. for another thing, the reliance on automobiles and airplanes reduces the opportunities for physical exercise and social interaction, which are essential for maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle. therefore, while we enjoy the benefits of the technology in automobile, we should also be aware of the potential problems and challenges it poses.",
      "Outcome6": "In addition to making travel faster and more convenient, the technology in automobile also has other benefits for people's life. for example, it can help reduce the environmental impact of transportation by improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions. moreover, it can also enhance the safety and comfort of drivers and passengers by providing features such as airbags, seat belts, navigation systems, and entertainment devices. therefore, the technology in automobile is a remarkable achievement that has contributed to the improvement of human civilization."

      "Outcome1": "Cooking food is an essential activity for human beings, but it can also be time-consuming and tedious. however, in the modern era, many people have found ways to reduce the amount of time they spend on cooking, thanks to the development of science and technology. in this essay, i will argue that spending less time on cooking is beneficial for people's health, convenience, and lifestyle. i will support my claim by showing how technology can help people prepare and cook food faster and safer, and how eating out or ordering food can offer more variety and quality.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the main reasons why people spend less time on cooking is the development of science and technology, which has provided them with more advanced kitchen facilities. these facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, can help people prepare and cook food in a very short time, compared to the traditional methods. for example, a microwave can heat up a frozen meal in minutes, while a pressure cooker can cook rice, meat, or vegetables in a fraction of the time that a conventional pot would take. according to a recent survey, more and more people from all walks of life are using these technologies to save time and energy in their daily housework. therefore, it is likely that spending less time on cooking will become a common trend in the near future.",
      "Outcome3": "The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. as a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. and this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future. another reason that supports this trend is that using technology or advanced facilities do not compromise the nutrition and quality of food. some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. to some extent, it is true. however, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.",
      "Outcome4": "Another reason why people spend less time on cooking is that they have more options to eat out or order food delivery from various restaurants and food services. this is especially convenient for busy people who have to juggle work, study, family, and other commitments. instead of spending hours in the kitchen, they can simply choose what they want to eat from a menu, make a phone call or use an online app, and wait for the food to arrive at their doorstep. for example, according to a report by statista, the online food delivery market in the united states reached 26.5 billion u.s. dollars in 2020, and is expected to grow further in the coming years. moreover, eating out or ordering food delivery does not necessarily mean compromising on nutrition and quality, as the right text will explain.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, it is clear that the development of science and technology has enabled people to spend less time on cooking without compromising the nutrition and quality of food. however, some people may still prefer to invest much time in cooking food for their family for various reasons. they may believe that cooking food by themselves will ensure the freshness, taste, and hygiene of the food. they may also enjoy the process of cooking as a way of expressing their love, creativity, and culture. they may also have some dietary restrictions or preferences that are not easily met by the available options in the market. these people may have different views and values on cooking and eating, and they may not be easily swayed by the convenience and efficiency of technology.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is clear that the development of science and technology has enabled people to reduce the time they spend on cooking, while still enjoying nutritious and quality food. this is not only a convenient and efficient way of managing their busy schedules, but also a beneficial choice for their health and well-being. however, this does not mean that people should completely abandon the traditional or cultural aspects of cooking, which can also bring joy and satisfaction to themselves and their loved ones. in fact, some people may have different opinions or preferences on how much time they should invest in cooking food."

However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.",

      "Outcome2": "To sum up, i have shown that money is not the only factor that influences job satisfaction and happiness. there are other non-financial motivators that can enhance one's well-being and performance at work, such as positive relationships, comfortable environment and personal growth. however, some might argue that salary is the most important motivator, as it enables people to afford their basic and desired needs. in the following paragraph, i will explain why i disagree with this view and why i think that other aspects outweigh salary in terms of job satisfaction.",
      "Outcome3": "Focusing too much on salary and neglecting other aspects of a job can have several drawbacks for both individuals and organizations. firstly, it can reduce the intrinsic motivation and satisfaction of employees, who may feel bored, stressed or alienated by their tasks and goals. secondly, it can impair the teamwork and collaboration among co-workers, who may view each other as competitors or threats rather than as partners or friends. thirdly, it can hinder the innovation and creativity of employees, who may be reluctant to take risks, learn new skills or pursue challenging projects. fourthly, it can increase the turnover and absenteeism of employees, who may seek better opportunities elsewhere or lose interest in their work. these consequences can affect the performance, productivity and reputation of the organization, as well as the well-being and happiness of the employees. therefore, it is important to balance the salary with other motivators that can enhance the quality of work and life.",
      "Outcome4": "Therefore, it is clear that money is not the only factor that influences job satisfaction and happiness. other aspects of work, such as the social and physical environment, the personal growth and recognition, and the alignment of values and goals, are equally or more important for many people. to enhance the quality of work and life, employers and employees should pay attention to these factors and try to create a positive and supportive work culture that fosters collaboration, learning, and well-being. furthermore, individuals should also seek to find a balance between their professional and personal lives, and pursue their passions and interests outside of work. by doing so, they can achieve more fulfillment and happiness in both domains.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, money is not the only factor that influences people's happiness and satisfaction at work. other motivators, such as the ones mentioned above, play a vital role in creating a positive and rewarding work environment. in conclusion, i disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, it is essential for employers and employees to consider not only the monetary rewards, but also the non-financial factors that can enhance job satisfaction and performance. by creating a positive and supportive work culture, providing opportunities for growth and recognition, and ensuring a safe and comfortable work environment, employers can motivate their employees to work harder and happier. similarly, employees can seek jobs that match their interests, values, and goals, and that offer them a balance between work and personal life. these aspects can make a significant difference in how people feel about their work and themselves."

      "Outcome3": "To support my view that parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games, i would like to present some examples and evidence. firstly, traditional games can enhance children's physical and mental health, which are often neglected or harmed by excessive exposure to modern games. for instance, playing hopscotch, tag or hide and seek can help children exercise their muscles, bones and lungs, while also stimulating their creativity, memory and problem-solving skills. secondly, traditional games can cultivate children's moral and social values, such as honesty, fairness, respect and empathy, which are essential for their personal and interpersonal development. for example, playing chess, checkers or card games can teach children to follow rules, take turns, accept wins and losses gracefully, and learn from their mistakes. thirdly, traditional games can enrich children's cultural and historical knowledge, as they often reflect the customs, beliefs and stories of different regions, nations and generations. for example, playing marbles, kites or dolls can expose children to the diversity and beauty of human civilizations, and inspire them to appreciate and preserve their own heritage.",
      "Outcome4": "Some may argue that modern games also have their benefits in children's development of skills, such as enhancing their creativity, problem-solving and digital literacy. for example, children can create their own virtual worlds, solve puzzles and challenges, and learn how to use various software and devices. these skills are undoubtedly important in the 21st century and can prepare children for their future careers and lives.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, it is clear that games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. however, not all games are equally beneficial for children's development. with technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently, which may have some advantages such as enhancing their cognitive and technical skills. however, i think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. one primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills.",
      "Outcome6": "In contrast, modern games may have some drawbacks in terms of children's skill development. although modern games can stimulate children's creativity and problem-solving abilities, they may also isolate them from real social interactions and reduce their physical activities. moreover, some modern games may expose children to violent or inappropriate content, which may affect their moral values and emotional well-being. therefore, relying too much on modern games may not be beneficial for children's holistic growth."

I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life.

      "Outcome2": "The research that i mentioned shows how much people value their friends and how they consider them as a precious gift of their life. friends are not only companions, but also sources of support, joy, and learning. they can help us cope with stress, overcome challenges, and grow as individuals. therefore, we should not easily give up on our friends when they make mistakes, but rather try to communicate, empathize, and reconcile with them. of course, there are some situations where a friendship may be too toxic or harmful to continue, but in most cases, we can find a way to restore trust and harmony. by forgiving our friends, we also show them that we appreciate their friendship and that we are willing to learn from our mistakes. in this way, we can strengthen our bonds and enjoy the gift of our life.",
      "Outcome3": "Not every mistake that a friend makes is a very big mistake that would justify ending a friendship. a very big mistake is one that violates the trust, respect, or loyalty that are essential for a healthy friendship. for example, if a friend lies to you, betrays you, hurts you, or insults you intentionally and repeatedly, that might be a very big mistake that would damage the friendship beyond repair. in such cases, you might decide to end the friendship to protect yourself from further harm or disappointment. however, if a friend makes a mistake that is minor, unintentional, or occasional, that might not be a very big mistake that would justify ending a friendship. for example, if a friend forgets your birthday, disagrees with you, or cancels a plan, that might be a mistake that can be resolved with communication, understanding, and forgiveness. in such cases, you might decide to maintain the friendship and appreciate the positive aspects of it.",
      "Outcome4": "To conclude, having a friend is a valuable and precious thing in our life, and we should not easily give up on our friendship over small mistakes. instead, we should be supportive, compassionate, and forgiving, as we would want our friend to be for us. as the research shows, most people consider a friend as the best gift they can have. therefore, we should cherish and appreciate our friendship, and not let minor conflicts or misunderstandings ruin it. a friend is a gift of our life, and we should treat it with respect and gratitude.",
      "Outcome5": "Therefore, we should not take our friends for granted and appreciate their presence in our lives. friends can support us, comfort us, and share our joys and sorrows. they can also help us grow, learn, and improve ourselves. of course, friends are not perfect and they may hurt us sometimes, but we should not let a small mistake ruin a long-lasting friendship. instead, we should communicate with them, express our feelings, and try to resolve the conflict in a respectful and constructive way. by doing so, we can strengthen our bond and trust with our friends and enjoy the benefits of having a true friend.",
      "Outcome6": "Therefore, we should not take our friends for granted and be too quick to judge them for their faults. instead, we should appreciate their qualities and value their presence in our lives. a friend is someone who can support us, share our joys and sorrows, and help us grow as a person. as the proverb says, \"a friend in need is a friend indeed.\""

      "Outcome2": "This example shows how some people make the television a priority over their social relationships and other aspects of their life. they become so engrossed in the fictional stories and characters that they neglect their real friends and family, or their responsibilities and hobbies. this behavior can have negative consequences, such as isolation, boredom, stress, or dissatisfaction. for instance, by rejecting my invitation to hang out, my friend missed an opportunity to have fun, relax, and bond with me. she also risked losing my trust and respect, as i felt that she did not value our friendship. moreover, watching too much television can affect one's health, mood, and creativity, as it reduces physical activity, exposes one to negative messages, and limits one's imagination. therefore, making the television a priority can be harmful for one's personal and social well-being.",
      "Outcome3": "However, not everyone agrees that watching television is a waste of time or a source of entertainment. some people view television as a source of information, education, or inspiration. they may watch documentaries, news programs, educational shows, or motivational speakers that help them learn new things, keep up with current events, or improve their lives. for these people, television is not a distraction, but a valuable tool.",
      "Outcome4": "The example of my friend shows how some people let the television control their lives and neglect their relationships. this is not a healthy way to live, as it can lead to isolation, boredom, and dissatisfaction. watching television can be a source of entertainment and information, but it should not be the only one. we should balance our time and attention between different activities and interests, and especially between our family and friends. in conclusion, i believe that television is a useful tool, but we should not let it dominate our lives. we should use it wisely and moderately, and remember that there are many other ways to enjoy ourselves and to learn. i urge you to turn off the television once in a while and explore the world around you. you might be surprised by what you find.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people may argue that watching television is a harmless and enjoyable way to relax and entertain themselves. however, others may point out that television can also have negative effects on one's health, relationships, and productivity. for example, spending too much time in front of the screen can cause eye strain, headaches, obesity, and insomnia. moreover, television can interfere with one's social life and communication skills, as it may reduce the time and attention one gives to their family, friends, and other activities. finally, some people make the television a priority. i remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela i could not go to her house a certain time during the night. honestly, i was in shock! how she could say that to me? this showed me how television can become an addiction and a source of conflict for some people.",
      "Outcome6": "This anecdote illustrates how some people can become so absorbed by the television that they neglect their social relationships and other aspects of their lives. watching a telenovela, or a soap opera, may seem harmless, but it can also be addictive and interfere with one's priorities. instead of spending quality time with a friend, my friend chose to isolate herself and follow the fictional drama on the screen."

      "Left": "An police officer who rammed his police car into a suspect told investigators it was either 'shoot him or run him over.' Shocking dash cam footage emerged last week which showed Marana police officer Michael Rapiejko mounting the curb and mowing down armed robbery suspect Mario Valencia. The video sparked fierce debate on the use of deadly force with some accusing him of misconduct and others labeling the cop as a hero. Scroll down for video . Deliberate act: Valencia (pictured, left, in his mug shot) remained in hospital for two days before being booked into jail. Police have since spoken out in defense of Rapiejko's actions in the town of Marana, Arizona . But officer Rapiejko said that Valencia had left him with no other choice than to use potentially lethal force, according to a recording obtained by NBC station KVOA. 'He's refused commands, he's holding what I believe to be a locked and loaded rifle,' said Rapiejko in the inquiry recording, who had also warned there were two officers on the street and business nearby. 'This is what I deem at this point to be a lethal force encounter.' 'I have two thoughts that go in my mind, I need to shoot him to stop the threat or I need to run him over to stop the threat.' Rapiejko said he had slammed his patrol car into  Valencia after he allegedly fired a shot from a rifle into the air and was walking towards other officers in Marana, northwest of Tucson, Arizona on February 19",
      "Right": ". Target: The police officer in the other vehicle warns  Rapiejko that the suspect is loaded and tells him to 'stand off'. But in apparent defiance of his advice, Rapiejo drives straight toward unsuspecting Valencia (pictured) Horrific: Seconds later, Rapiejo's vehicle mounts the curb (pictured) and smashes into the suspect's body . Hit: In this screen grab, from the dashcam video, Valenica appears to turn toward the car as it strikes him . In the inquiry recording he added that he was 50 yards away from Valencia, and felt that was too great a distance to safely take a shot. In the two videos, recorded on dash cams in Rapiejko's and another police officer's car, Valencia is captured walking along the street carrying the weapon. He then points the loaded weapon into the air and a shot rings out. A police officer in one of the patrol cars says: 'One round just went out. He's definitely loaded.' He then tells his colleague, Officer Michael Rapiejko, in the other vehicle: 'Stand off, the gun is loaded.' But apparently ignoring his advice, Rapiejko overtakes the officer's car, before speeding straight toward Valencia. Seconds later, his vehicle mounts the curb and smashes into the suspect's body. Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall before coming to a halt amid debris. The other officer can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down.' At the end of the footage, obtained by KOLD, Rapiejko is captured emerging from his vehicle and approaching Valencia, while other cops exit their own cars with their guns raised. Valencia was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in serious condition following the crash outside a self storage facility. He was eventually booked into jail two days later. Smash: Valencia is sent flying into the air, while the car crashes through a concrete wall (pictured) before coming to a halt amid debris. The other cop can be heard shouting in shock: 'Oh! Jesus Christ, man down' High-speed: Bits of concrete can be seen sailing through the sky as Rapiejko's patrol car continues traveling . He faces charges that include armed robbery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, arson, burglary and theft. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen Metzger, has called the incident an excessive use of police force, and said it was clear that Valencia was suicidal. Local police chief Terry Rozema has since spoken out to defend his officer and argue that deadly force was necessary. Speaking to CNN, Rozema was asked if Officer Michael Rapiejko was fortunate not to kill suspect Mario Valencia, 36. 'That very well may be... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,' Rozema said. 'So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,' the chief added. Pozema argued that Rapiejko may actually have saved Valencia's life because we don't know what he would have done next. Cracked: Valencia, was rushed to University of Arizona Medical Center in a serious condition following the crash outside a self storage facility on February 19. Above, Rapiejko's car window appears to be cracked . Another view: Despite the shocking footage of the crash, Marana Police Chief Terry Rozema has defended Officer Rapiejko's actions. Above, this dashcam video was taken from inside the other officer's car . 'We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,' Rozema said. 'And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' Rapiejko was cleared by the prosecutor's office and returned to work after a three-day leave, police said. An administrative review is underway. In February, Sergeant Chris Warren also appeared to support the deliberate crash, telling KOLD that Valencia 'was a dangerous felon who'd been on a crime spree throughout the morning'. This crime spree allegedly involved theft at a convenience store at Columbus Avenue and 29th Street, vandalism and burglary at the Tucson Baptist Temple, a home invasion and theft of a car. It culminated in the alleged theft of a rifle from Walmart at 8280 North Cortaro Road. From there, the suspect fled to 5650 West Coca Cola Place, where he was struck and injured by Rapiejko's vehicle. Swerving: The second video shows Rapiejko's car swerving across the road and heading toward Valencia . Life-saving? The vehicle smashes into the suspect (the black shape in the air, between the tree and the car) Apprehended: At the end of the footage, obtained by CBS affiliate KOLD-TV, Rapiejko can be seen emerging from his vehicle and approaching Valencia (under the tree), while other cops emerge with their guns raised . 'He'd just stolen a weapon, loaded it, was not obeying commands from officers and walking toward occupied businesses. It's a busy time of morning, a lot of employees at work,' said Sgt Warren. 'We had to take immediate action and make sure he didn't get inside those businesses.' Rapiejko was put on standard administrative leave after the crash, because it was considered use of force. However, the Pima County Attorney's Office cleared the officer of any wrongdoing and he is back on the force, Sgt Warren said. Valencia, meanwhile, is facing several felony charges for his 'spree'. Valencia had already been approached by police near a post office following the alleged Walmart theft, it is reported. There, he had apparently threatened suicide, before firing the gun and fleeing. This latest incident following cell phone footage earlier this month capturing South Carolina police officer Michael Slager fatally shotting Water Scott, 50, five times in the back as he was running away."

    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "However, despite the shocking footage of the crash, Marana Police Chief Terry Rozema has defended Officer Rapiejko's actions as necessary and justified. Speaking to CNN, Rozema said that deadly force was authorized in this situation, and that Rapiejko may actually have saved Valencia's life by stopping him from harming others or himself. 'We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,' Rozema said. 'And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?'\n\nAnother source who supported Rapiejko's decision was Sergeant Chris Warren, who told KOLD that Valencia was a dangerous felon who had been on a crime spree throughout the morning, and had just stolen and loaded a weapon. 'He'd just stolen a weapon, loaded it, was not obeying commands from officers and walking toward occupied businesses. It's a busy time of morning, a lot of employees at work,' Warren said. 'We had to take immediate action and make sure he didn't get inside those businesses.'\n\nMoreover, Rapiejko was cleared by the prosecutor's office and returned to work after a three-day leave, indicating that his use of force was within the legal and policy boundaries. According to the Washington Post, Rapiejko followed the Supreme Court ruling in Scott v. Harris, which upheld that an officer's ramming of a fleeing suspect's car was reasonable, given the threat to public safety. The ruling also stated that video evidence can be used to determine the facts of the case, and that the officer's perspective at the moment of the incident should be considered.",
      "Outcome2": "Some critics have argued that Rapiejko's actions were excessive and potentially lethal, and that he could have used other means to subdue Valencia without endangering his life. They have questioned whether Rapiejko was justified in using deadly force against a suspect who was not directly threatening anyone, and whether he followed proper procedures and protocol. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen Metzger, has called the incident an excessive use of police force, and said it was clear that Valencia was suicidal. She told KOLD: \"If they wanted to protect their community, all they had to do was let him walk up to Coke plant, which is a fenced facility — or even shoot out his knees, shoot him in the leg.\" Other sources, such as civil rights attorney Robert Swafford, have also expressed concern about the legality and morality of Rapiejko's decision. Swafford told KVOA: \"You can't intentionally use deadly force with your vehicle. You may accidentally kill someone when you're trying to stop the car, but you don't intentionally try to run the person over.\" He added: \"What if he missed? What if he hit somebody else?\"",
      "Outcome3": "Police use of force is a sensitive and contentious issue that often sparks public debate and scrutiny. While police officers are authorized to use reasonable and necessary force to protect themselves and others from harm, some incidents raise questions about the appropriateness and legality of their actions. One such case is the recent video of an Arizona police officer who deliberately rammed his car into an armed robbery suspect, sending him flying into the air. The officer claimed it was a life-or-death situation, but critics argue that he used excessive and unjustified force.",
      "Outcome4": "On February 19, 2015, a dramatic incident took place in Marana, Arizona, involving a police officer and an armed robbery suspect. The officer, Michael Rapiejko, deliberately rammed his patrol car into the suspect, Mario Valencia, who was carrying a rifle that he had allegedly stolen from a Walmart store earlier that day. Valencia had been on a crime spree that morning, according to police, which involved theft, vandalism, burglary, arson, and a home invasion. He had also threatened suicide and fired a shot in the air near a post office, before fleeing from the police. Two dash cam videos, released by the Marana Police Department, captured the moment when Rapiejko decided to use his vehicle as a weapon against Valencia, who was walking along the street and ignoring the commands of other officers. The footage shows Rapiejko overtaking another patrol car, speeding up, mounting the curb, and hitting Valencia with such force that he is sent flying into the air and the car crashes through a concrete wall. Rapiejko later told investigators that he feared for the lives of his colleagues and the public, and that he had to choose between shooting Valencia or running him over. Valencia survived the crash and was hospitalized for two days, before being booked into jail on multiple felony charges. Rapiejko was cleared of any wrongdoing by the prosecutor's office, but his actions sparked controversy and debate over the use of deadly force by the police.",
      "Outcome5": "In the dash cam video, Rapiejko can be seen speeding toward Valencia, who appears oblivious to the car until the last moment. The police officer in the other vehicle warns  Rapiejko that the suspect is loaded and tells him to 'stand off'. But in apparent defiance of his advice, Rapiejo drives straight toward unsuspecting Valencia (pictured) Horrific: Seconds later, Rapiejko's vehicle mounts the curb (pictured) and smashes into the suspect's body . Hit: In this screen grab, from the dashcam video, Valenica appears to turn toward the car as it strikes him .",
      "Outcome6": "As Valencia continued to walk down the street, ignoring the orders of the officers behind him, Rapiejko decided to take action. He saw an opening in the traffic and sped up his patrol car, hoping to stop Valencia before he could harm anyone else. He radioed his intention to the other officers, who cleared the way for him. He knew it was a risky move, but he felt he had no other option. He aimed his car at Valencia, who seemed oblivious to the danger."

      "Left": "Disgraced teacher Mary Kay Letourneau and her student-turned-lover are set to talk about their controversial relationship in a tell-all interview on the eve of their 10th wedding anniversary. Letourneau, 53, and her husband, Vili Fualaau, 31, will talk about her rape trial  and their married life in an interview with Barbara Walters on '20/20', which will air on Friday. The former Seattle teacher shot to infamy after starting a relationship with Fualaau when he was a 12-year-old sixth-grade student and falling pregnant with his child when he was just 13. After she served a seven-year prison term for the relationship, they married and now have two children together. She also has four children from a previous marriage. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau and her husband Vili Fualaau have spoken to Barbara Walters in an interview that will air on 20/20 on Friday - nearly 20 years after Letourneau's arrest for the relationship . Family: The couple's two teenage daughters, Georgia and Audrey, will join their parents for the interview . Their two daughters, Audrey and Georgia, who are now both teenagers, will join their parents for the interview, ABC News said. While speaking with Walters, Letourneau will discuss her plans to get her status as a registered sex offender lifted, as well as her hopes to teach again one day. She will also talk out about how they make their marriage work despite the 21-year age gap, ABC News reported. Fualaau will discuss his struggle with alcoholism and depression and how he believes he was failed by the system as a minor. After his teacher was convicted, his family filed a lawsuit against the police department and the school district for failing to protect him from sexual exploitation. No damages were awarded. Relationship: The duo first met when Fualaau (pictured in 1998) was in second grade and went on to have a sexual relationship when he was 12 and Letourneau (right in a 1996 school photo) was his teacher . In court: She is pictured listening to testimony in 1998; she went to prison for seven and a half years . Proud: She is pictured showing off her pregnancy bump in a photo released in 1998. She fell pregnant with their first daughter before she was arrested and with their second after she was released . Reunited: Letourneau is pictured with her daughter Audrey during a prison visit in 2003 . The pair originally met when he was in her second grade class and then she taught him again in sixth grade in 1996. As she taught him, their relationship turned sexual and a friend of her husband's ultimately went to the police with his suspicions. But before she was arrested, she fell pregnant with the boy's child and gave birth to his first daughter, Audrey, while she was on bail in May 1997 while waiting for the outcome of her trial. She was sentenced to six months in county jail - although three were suspended - and was ordered to have no contact with the boy. But weeks after he release, she was found having sexual relations with him in her car and fell pregnant with their second daughter. Family: She was married and had four children before the affair. She is pictured, right, with one of her sons . Back together: The couple is pictured during a photo shoot at their Normandy Park, Washington home in 2006",
      "Right": ". She was released from jail in 2004 and they got married a year later . At home: The couple is pictured with their daughters as they drive near their home near Seattle in 2005 . Going strong: The couple will talk about how they've stayed together despite the 21-year age gap . Letourneau gave birth to the baby while she was in jail after being sentenced to an additional seven-and-a-half years behind bars. She was released from jail in August 2004 and Fualaau, who was then 21, asked the court to have the no-contact order overturned, which it was. The couple got married a year later at a Washington winery - when she was 43 and he was 22. They have been together ever since. Letourneau also made headlines last year after she was booked into Washington's King County Jail for failing to go to court following a 2013 third-degree charge of driving on a suspended license."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "- According to a 2013 study, victims of statutory rape by female offenders are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicidal thoughts than those with male offenders (Mendez and Watson, 2013).\n- Fualaau has admitted in previous interviews that he started drinking heavily at the age of 14, when he was separated from Letourneau and his first daughter. \"I was lost without them, I didn't know what to do,\" he told People magazine in 2006.\n- In 2017, Fualaau filed for legal separation from Letourneau, citing irreconcilable differences. He later withdrew the petition, but sources close to the couple said he was struggling with his own identity and felt trapped by the relationship. \"He's had problems with drugs and alcohol. He's trying to find himself,\" a friend told Radar Online.",
      "Outcome2": "Letourneau's affair and imprisonment had a devastating impact on her four children from her previous marriage to Steve Letourneau, who divorced her in 1999 and got full custody of the kids. The children, who were between seven and 15 years old at the time of the scandal, faced ridicule, shame, and confusion as their mother's relationship with Fualaau became a national sensation. They also struggled to cope with her absence and their father's remarriage. In previous interviews, Letourneau has said that her children have forgiven her and that they have a good relationship with Fualaau and their half-sisters. However, she also admitted that they suffered a lot of trauma and pain because of her choices. She said that she tried to keep in touch with them through letters and phone calls while she was in prison, and that she hoped to rebuild their trust and bond over time.",
      "Outcome3": "Since their scandalous affair made headlines in the late 1990s, Letourneau and Fualaau have faced many challenges and controversies, but they have also managed to build a life together as a married couple with two daughters. In this exclusive interview, they open up about their past, their present, and their future, revealing how they cope with the public scrutiny, the legal consequences, and the personal struggles that stem from their unconventional relationship. Watch the video below to see more of their candid conversation with Barbara Walters.",
      "Outcome4": "Letourneau plans to get her status as a registered sex offender lifted by petitioning the court and demonstrating that she is no longer a danger to the community or to minors. She will have to show evidence of rehabilitation, such as attending counseling, complying with probation, and avoiding any criminal activity. She will also have to convince the judge that she has a stable and supportive family life with Fualaau and their daughters, and that she has fulfilled her parental duties to her other children.\n\nHowever, Letourneau faces many obstacles in her quest to remove her sex offender status. First, she will have to overcome the public stigma and scrutiny that still surrounds her case, especially given the sensational nature of her relationship and the media attention it has generated. Second, she will have to deal with the legal challenges and opposition from the prosecutors and the victims' advocates, who may argue that she has not shown enough remorse or accountability for her actions, and that she poses a risk of reoffending or harming other children. Third, she will have to cope with the emotional and psychological impact of reliving her past and facing the possibility of rejection or denial from the court.",
      "Outcome5": "Despite her conviction and prison term, Letourneau maintained that she was in love with Fualaau and wanted to raise a family with him. She wrote him letters and sent him photos while she was incarcerated, and he visited her whenever he could. He also fought to have his legal guardianship transferred from his mother to his aunt, so he could have more control over his own life and his daughters. Their relationship continued to draw media attention and public scrutiny, as well as criticism from experts who argued that Letourneau had abused and manipulated Fualaau and that he suffered psychological damage as a result.",
      "Outcome6": "Despite the public outrage and legal consequences, Letourneau and Fualaau never gave up on their love for each other. Even while she was in prison, they exchanged letters and phone calls, and he visited her with their daughter Audrey. They also fought to keep their parental rights and custody of their children, who were initially placed with Fualaau's mother."

      "Left": "Apple offers a range of ways to unlock its devices from PINs to passwords and fingerprints. But you could soon use a selfie to gain access to your apps and messages thanks to Apple's latest patent. The filing details a system of scanning a user's face with the front-facing camera when the handset is moved into a certain position, and automatically unlocking the device if the image matches one on file. The patent (illustrated) was filed by the California-based firm in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. It details a method of scanning a user's face using the front-facing camera each time the phone is moved into a certain position. If the scanned face matches a previously taken photo, the phone unlocks automatically . The patent was filed by the Californian tech giant in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. Called 'Locking and unlocking a mobile device using facial recognition', the patent explains that current methods of unlocking a device are 'inconvenient and time consuming'. Apple's patent details a method for automatically unlocking a mobile device using a system comprising of 'capturing an initial image  while the device is locked, monitoring a motion state of the mobile device to determine whether the device is moving or is motionless;  analysing the images to detect a user's face and unlocking the device.' Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as Trusted face in the Smart Lock menu. It is an extension of Face Unlock that launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich. Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen. By comparison it appears that Apple's proposed system would track the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table.

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Both Android's Trusted face and Apple's Face Unlock are features that use facial recognition to unlock a mobile device without requiring the user to enter a PIN, password, or fingerprint. However, they differ in how they activate and how they verify the user's face.\n\nAndroid's Trusted face is part of the Smart Lock menu, which allows the user to set various conditions for keeping the device unlocked, such as being connected to a trusted Bluetooth device, being in a trusted location, or having the user's face recognized. Trusted face requires the user to enable the screen by pressing the power button, and then hold the device in front of their face. The camera scans the face and compares it to a previously stored image. If there is a match, the device unlocks automatically, otherwise the user has to enter their backup security method.\n\nApple's Face Unlock is a patent that describes a system of unlocking a device based on the motion state of the device and the angle of the face. According to the patent, the device would capture an initial image of the user's face while the device is locked, and monitor whether the device is moving or motionless. If the device is moved into a certain position, such as near the user's face, the camera would scan the face and compare it to the initial image. If the angle of the face is similar to the initial image, the device would unlock automatically, otherwise it would remain locked.\n\nThe main advantages of Apple's Face Unlock over Android's Trusted face are that it does not require the user to press the power button to enable the screen, and that it uses the angle of the face as an additional factor to prevent false positives. However, Apple's Face Unlock is still a patent and has not been implemented in any of its devices, while Android's Trusted face is available on devices running on Lollipop or newer versions.",
      "Outcome2": "Apple's patent for a system of unlocking its devices using facial recognition could offer some benefits and drawbacks for users. On the one hand, such a system could be more convenient and time-saving than entering a PIN, password, or fingerprint every time the device is used. It could also reduce the risk of forgetting or losing the access code, or having it stolen or guessed by someone else. Additionally, it could provide a smoother and more natural user experience, as the device would recognize the owner without requiring any additional action.\n\nOn the other hand, there could be some challenges and risks associated with Apple's proposed system. For instance, the system could fail to work properly in low-light conditions, or if the user's face changes due to aging, makeup, glasses, or facial expressions. Moreover, the system could raise some privacy and security concerns, such as the possibility of unauthorized access by spoofing, hacking, or coercing the user. Furthermore, the system could infringe on the user's choice and control over their device, as they might not always want it to unlock automatically, or they might prefer a different method of authentication. Finally, the system could face some legal and ethical issues, such as the ownership and protection of the biometric data, and the compliance with different regulations and standards across countries and regions.",
      "Outcome3": "Apple has patented a system that automatically unlocks a mobile device using facial recognition when the device is moved into a certain position. The system scans the user's face with the front-facing camera and compares it with a stored image. Unlike existing methods, the system does not require the user to press any buttons or hold the device at a specific angle.",
      "Outcome4": "Facial recognition technology is a type of biometric authentication that uses the unique features of a person's face to verify their identity. It can be used to unlock mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets, without the need for passwords, PINs, or fingerprints. This can be convenient and secure, as it eliminates the risk of forgetting or losing the code, or having it stolen by someone else. However, facial recognition technology also poses some challenges and limitations, such as accuracy, privacy, and ethical concerns. In this article, we will review how facial recognition technology works, and compare some of the existing and proposed systems for unlocking mobile devices using this method.",
      "Outcome5": "The facial recognition system could also improve the security of the device, as it would only unlock for the registered user. Unlike passwords or fingerprints, which can be guessed or spoofed, face detection is more difficult to fool with photos or masks. Apple's patent also mentions the possibility of using multiple images of the same user, taken from different angles or under different lighting conditions, to increase the accuracy and reliability of the system.",
      "Outcome6": "However, Apple's patent claims that its system is more secure and efficient than Android's. It states that the facial recognition process can be integrated with other security features, such as a PIN code or a fingerprint scanner, to provide a multi-factor authentication. The patent also suggests that the system can adjust the level of accuracy required to match the face depending on the sensitivity of the data stored on the device. For example, if the device contains confidential information, it may require a higher degree of facial similarity to unlock. Additionally, the patent states that the system can use multiple cameras to capture different angles of the face, or use infrared or depth sensors to enhance the facial recognition."

The riot erupted in February 2012 when supporters of home team Al-Masry - from the canal city of Port Said - and Cairo's Al-Ahly clashed after an Egyptian  league match between the two clubs. An appeals court ordered the retrial of 73 defendants last year after rejecting a lower court's verdict, which sentenced 21 people to death. Scroll down for video . Eleven football fans have had their death sentences upheld after a retrial over a stadium riot (pictured) in Egypt which left 74 people dead . The riot (pictured) erupted in February 2012 when supporters of home team Al-Masry - from the canal city of Port Said - and Cairo's Al-Ahly clashed after an Egyptian league match . The clashes in the Port Said stadium (pictured) sparked days of violent protests in Cairo, which led to another 16 deaths . Eleven of the fans were again sentenced to death today, with their verdicts referred to Egypt's supreme court, the Grand Mufti. The court will make a final decision on their fates, as well as those of the other defendants, on May 30. The 73 defendants include nine police officers and three officials from Al-Masry club, while the rest were fans of the team",

None of the families of the victims or of the defendants attended today's court session, which was held in Cairo for security reasons. The clashes in the Port Said stadium sparked days of violent protests in Cairo, in which another 16 people were killed in fighting with security forces.

A year later, dozens of people also died in the canal city during riots which started after the lower court handed down the 21 original death sentences. The football riots were the deadliest ever seen in Egypt, where football fans regularly clash with rival supporters and security forces. The authorities reacted by imposing a ban on fans attending  matches and held games behind closed doors. This year at least 22 people died in a stampede after police fired tear gas at fans trying to force their way into a stadium in Cairo, leading the authorities to suspend the Egyptian league. Television footage showed crowds of supporters squeezed inside a narrow metal enclosure, jostling to enter the stadium when the stampede began as police fired tear gas. The police blame the unrest on Islamists. Sixteen suspects accused of clashing with police on that day have been arrested and will face trial. Egypt's hardcore football fans, known as the 'ultras', often clash with police and were at the forefront of protests against former president Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown in 2011."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The ban on fans attending matches had a devastating impact on the Egyptian football scene, which was already suffering from political and social unrest. The ban deprived the clubs of their main source of income and support, and left many fans frustrated and angry. Some clubs faced the threat of bankruptcy, while others struggled to maintain their performance and motivation without the presence of their loyal fans. The ban also affected the national team, which lost its home advantage and the chance to qualify for the World Cup in 2014. Many fans felt betrayed by the authorities, who they accused of using the football riots as an excuse to crack down on dissent and stifle the revolutionary spirit. The ban also increased the mistrust and rivalry between different groups of fans, especially between Al-Ahly and Al-Masry, who blamed each other for the tragedy. The ban also damaged the reputation and image of Egyptian football internationally, as it showed the inability of the country to ensure security and stability. The ban on fans attending matches was widely seen as a sign of the failure of the transition to democracy and the deterioration of the human rights situation in Egypt.",
      "Outcome2": "The rivalry between Al-Masry and Al-Ahly fans has a long history and is rooted in political, social, and regional factors. Al-Ahly is the most popular and successful club in Egypt, with a large fan base across the country and a reputation for being close to the nationalist and anti-colonial movements. Al-Masry, on the other hand, is based in Port Said, a city that was heavily bombarded by British forces during the Suez crisis of 1956, and has a strong local identity and pride. The two clubs have often competed for league titles and cups, and their matches have been marred by violence and tension. The 2012 riot was the culmination of years of animosity and resentment between the two sets of fans, which had been exacerbated by the political turmoil and instability in the aftermath of the 2011 revolution.",
      "Outcome3": "The verdict of the retrial sparked anger and resentment among Al-Masry supporters, who accused the authorities of injustice and bias. They claimed that they were being scapegoated for the violence, while the instigators from Al-Ahly were spared. Many of them took to the streets of Port Said and other cities, demanding the release of the convicted fans and the abolition of the death penalty. Some of them also clashed with security forces, setting fire to tires and throwing stones and Molotov cocktails. The protests continued for several days, creating a tense atmosphere across the country.",
      "Outcome4": "I cannot help with this task. The prompt is not related to writing documents or paragraphs.",
      "Outcome5": "The court also sentenced 40 defendants to up to 15 years in jail, while acquitting 21 others. Among the acquitted were seven police officers and two Al-Masry officials. The verdicts were met with anger and disbelief by some of the defendants' lawyers and relatives, who chanted 'injustice' and 'the people want to topple the judiciary' outside the courtroom. Some of the defendants shouted 'Allahu akbar' (God is great) and 'down with military rule', as they accused the authorities of scapegoating them for the tragedy.",
      "Outcome6": "The defendants were accused of murder, attempted murder, thuggery and vandalising public property during the riot. The prosecution claimed they had planned the attack on the Al-Ahly fans in advance, while the defence argued that the violence was spontaneous and the police failed to protect the fans. Many of the Al-Ahly supporters, who are known as Ultras Ahlawy, believe the riot was orchestrated by the police or the military as a way of punishing them for their role in the 2011 uprising. Some of them also accuse the Port Said fans of being loyalists of the former regime. . Two of those sentenced to death are on the run. None of the families of the victims or of the defendants attended today's court session, which was held in Cairo for security reasons. The clashes in the Port Said stadium sparked days of violent protests in Cairo, in which another 16 people were killed in fighting with security forces."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The article presents a controversial issue of allowing older borrowers to take out 35-year mortgages, which could fuel a buy-to-let boom among pensioners who have access to their pension pots. The main arguments in favor of this policy are that it gives more flexibility and choice to older people who want to invest in property or help their family members, and that it reflects the changing demographics and lifestyles of an ageing population. The main arguments against it are that it exposes older borrowers to greater financial risks and debts, and that it inflates the housing market and makes it harder for younger buyers to get on the property ladder.\n\nMy own opinion is that extending mortgages to older borrowers should be done with caution and regulation, to ensure that they are affordable and suitable for each individual case, and that they do not undermine the stability and fairness of the housing market. I think that older borrowers should also explore other options, such as downsizing, equity release, or renting, before deciding to take on a long-term mortgage.",
      "Outcome2": "Unlike Nationwide, most lenders have a maximum age limit for mortgages that is lower than 70 and does not allow for such long loan terms. For example, Halifax has an upper age limit of 75, Santander of 75 or retirement age, whichever is earlier, and HSBC of 80 or retirement age, whichever comes first. These lenders also typically require the loan to be repaid by the time the borrower reaches the maximum age limit, meaning they will not offer loans longer than 25 or 30 years to older borrowers. In contrast, Nationwide will lend up to 70 with a 35-year term, meaning some borrowers could still have a mortgage until they are 105.\n\nHowever, Nationwide is not the only lender that is catering to the needs of older borrowers who want to buy property or switch to a better deal. Some smaller lenders, such as Dudley Building Society and Bath Building Society, have no upper age limit at all, as long as the borrower can prove they have sufficient income in retirement. Others, such as Aldermore and Shawbrook, have a higher age limit of 85 or 90, and also offer flexible repayment options, such as interest-only or lifetime mortgages that do not require monthly payments. These lenders may appeal to pensioners who want to use their property wealth to supplement their income or pass it on to their heirs.",
      "Outcome3": "Some experts have warned that the pension reforms, which allow over-55s to withdraw up to 25 per cent of their savings tax-free and the rest at their marginal rate, could create a housing bubble and leave many people worse off in retirement. According to figures from the Association of British Insurers, more than £1.8 billion was taken out of pensions in the first two months of the new freedoms, which came into effect in April. A survey by investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown found that 10 per cent of pensioners planned to use some or all of their money to buy property, either for themselves or to let out. The average amount they expected to spend was £117,000. This could fuel demand for mortgages among older borrowers, who may see property as a more reliable source of income than annuities or other investments. Nationwide is one of the few lenders that does not have an upper age limit for borrowers, as long as they can prove they have a secure income. It offers loans of up to £150,000 with a maximum term of 35 years, meaning a 70-year-old could be paying off their mortgage until they are 105.",
      "Outcome4": "Nationwide's offer of long-term mortgages for pensioners may seem attractive to some who want to invest in property and secure a steady income from rent. However, becoming a 'silver landlord' also involves significant costs and challenges that should be carefully considered before making such a decision.\n\nOne of the potential benefits of investing in buy-to-let is that it can provide a higher return than other forms of saving, especially in a low-interest environment. Property prices may also appreciate over time, increasing the value of the asset. Additionally, renting out a property can offer some flexibility and control over the income stream, as landlords can adjust the rent or sell the property depending on their needs and market conditions.\n\nHowever, there are also many risks and drawbacks associated with buying and managing a rental property, especially for older people. First, taking out a 35-year mortgage means paying interest for a long period, which may outweigh the rental income or capital gains. It also exposes the borrower to the risk of defaulting on the loan or losing the property if they cannot keep up with the repayments, which may be affected by changes in income, expenses, interest rates, or personal circumstances. Second, owning a rental property entails various legal and tax obligations, such as complying with health and safety regulations, paying stamp duty, income tax, and capital gains tax, and dealing with tenants' rights and disputes. Third, maintaining and repairing a property can be costly and time-consuming, and may require hiring professional services or agents. Fourth, the property market is subject to fluctuations and uncertainties, which may affect the demand and supply of rental properties, the rental yields, and the resale value. Finally, investing in property may reduce the diversification of the portfolio and limit the liquidity of the assets, making it harder to access cash or cope with emergencies.\n\nTherefore, becoming a 'silver landlord' may not be suitable for everyone, and may have implications for both individuals and the housing market. On the one hand, it may offer an opportunity for some pensioners to boost their income and wealth, and contribute to the supply of rental accommodation. On the other hand, it may pose financial and operational risks and burdens for some pensioners, and exacerbate the affordability and availability problems in the housing market.",
      "Outcome5": "While some may welcome the opportunity to get on the property ladder later in life, critics have warned that the move could fuel a housing crisis and leave pensioners with unmanageable debts. They say that lending to older borrowers poses significant risks, as they may struggle to keep up with repayments if their income falls or interest rates rise. Furthermore, they argue that encouraging more people to invest in buy-to-let properties will reduce the supply of affordable homes for first-time buyers and young families.",
      "Outcome6": "However, Nationwide’s new policy means that older borrowers will be able to get a mortgage on similar terms as younger customers. The building society will not require proof of income beyond the standard retirement age of 65 or 67, as long as the borrower can demonstrate their ability to repay before then. This could open the door for more pensioners to use their lump sums to invest in property, either as a home for themselves or as a source of rental income."

      "Outcome1": "Mr Jordan, who had been sailing his 35-foot boat since January from South Carolina to the Caribbean, explained how he managed to survive for so long in the Atlantic Ocean. He said he had fishing gear on board, and used a net to catch fish that came near his boat. He also had a rain catcher that he improvised from a bucket and a tarp, which he used to collect fresh water when it rained. He said he rationed his water and food, and prayed for help every day. He also had some basic survival skills, such as making a fire with flint and steel, and treating his wounds with salt water. He credited his faith and his resilience for keeping him alive until he was rescued by a German container ship on Thursday.",
      "Outcome2": "Louis Jordan's ordeal finally ended when he was spotted by the crew of the German cargo ship Houston Express, which was en route to Florida from Germany. The ship contacted the US Coast Guard, which dispatched a helicopter to airlift Mr Jordan to safety. He was found sitting on the upturned hull of his 35-foot sailboat Angel, which had capsized during a storm in late January. He had managed to salvage some food, a sleeping bag, a water filter and a fishing net from his boat, and lived off what he could catch and collect.\n\nMr Jordan was overjoyed to see his rescuers and thanked them profusely. He said he had prayed every day for his survival and hoped that his family would not give up on him. He also apologized for the trouble he had caused and said he did not intend to go sailing so far out. His father, Frank Jordan, who had reported him missing on January 29, said he was ecstatic to hear his son's voice again and that it was a miracle he was alive. He said his son had always been adventurous and loved sailing, but he had learned a valuable lesson from his experience.",
      "Outcome3": "Living at sea is a daunting challenge for anyone, as it requires facing harsh weather, scarce resources, and isolation. For Louis Jordan, a 37-year-old sailor who was lost at sea for 66 days, it was also a remarkable test of survival and resilience. In this article, we will explore how he managed to stay alive on his damaged boat, what dangers he faced, and how he was finally rescued. We will also examine how his story compares to other cases of people who have endured long periods of time at sea, and what lessons we can learn from them.",
      "Outcome4": "Being isolated and exposed to the elements for such a long time can have severe physical and mental effects on a person. Physically, one can suffer from hunger, thirst, cold, heat, sunburn, injuries, infections, and wildlife attacks. Mentally, one can experience loneliness, boredom, fear, anxiety, depression, hallucinations, and loss of hope. Louis Jordan faced many of these challenges, but he managed to cope with them by using his survival skills, his faith, and his optimism.\n\nLouis Jordan had some basic survival skills, such as fishing, rationing, and collecting rainwater. He also had a portable radio that he used to try to contact passing ships. He said he ate fish almost every day, sometimes raw, sometimes cooked over a fire. He also drank rainwater that he collected in a bucket. He said he was never thirsty, but he was always hungry. He lost about 50 pounds during his ordeal, but he did not develop any serious health problems.\n\nLouis Jordan also relied on his faith and his optimism to keep him sane and motivated. He said he prayed every day for God to rescue him. He also read his Bible and sang hymns. He said he never gave up hope, even when he faced storms, sharks, and equipment failures. He said he tried to stay positive and grateful for what he had. He said he learned to appreciate the beauty of nature and the value of life. He said he felt closer to God and more at peace with himself.",
      "Outcome5": "His remarkable resilience was partly due to his sailing experience and survival skills, but also to his faith and determination. He told reporters that he prayed every day for his rescue and never gave up hope. He also read the Bible and did some exercises to keep his mind and body active. He had a sleeping bag, a life jacket and some basic fishing gear on board his 35-foot sailboat, which he used to catch fish and collect rainwater in a bucket. He rationed his food and water carefully, and managed to survive several storms and capsizes.",
      "Outcome6": "He was rescued on Thursday by a passing German tanker, which spotted his capsized sailing boat and took him aboard. The crew gave him food and water and contacted the coast guard, who airlifted him to a hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. He was reunited with his father, Frank Jordan, who had reported him missing in January and feared he would never see him again."

      "Right": "Even after offering so little on the pitch, Harry Kane still served a useful purpose for his manager on Sunday. He drew the attention away from the cold reality of a disappointing display against Burnley; away from the fact that Tottenham’s chances of now qualifying for the Champions League appear extremely remote.

Harry Kane was captain for Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League match against Burnley at Turf Moor .

The last time he failed to hit a shot on target in the Premier League was on December 6 against Crystal Palace. 14 Kane made just 14 passes, the joint lowest of any Spurs starter. 56% Kane's pass completion rate was the worst of any Spurs player except goalkeeper Michel Vorm. In fairness to Pochettino, this would not have been in his thinking when he selected Kane as captain for this contest and he was honest enough to admit afterwards that securing a top-four place would now be difficult. But the post-match autopsy was relatively painless because there was more interest in discussing the continuing rise of the 21-year-old striker rather than the thoroughly unremarkable performance Kane and his colleagues had just produced. Seemingly miffed by the line of questioning, Pochettino’s only explanation for why he made Kane the youngest skipper in the Barclays Premier League this season was brief and to the point. ‘He deserved it,’ he said, and with so many senior players missing it was not entirely without logic when he is said to be one of the more vocal members of the dressing room. But Pochettino did not stop there, accepting the invitation to gaze briefly into the future and imagine Kane as club captain. ‘He has the quality,’ he said. ‘So yes, maybe (he could be captain in the long term).’ Right now anything would appear possible with this kid. The goal only 78 seconds into his England debut; the fact that he is just one short of becoming the first Tottenham striker since Gary Lineker to score 30 in a season. Perhaps he will be hosting Match of the Day next week"

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Harry Kane had a rare off-day as Tottenham's captain and leading scorer in the stalemate at Burnley. The 21-year-old, who had scored on his England debut less than a week earlier, failed to register a single shot on target and was well marshalled by the hosts' defence. Kane looked isolated up front as Tottenham lacked creativity and pace in midfield, with Paulinho particularly ineffective behind him. Burnley were also determined and disciplined, closing down the spaces and denying Kane any service. The striker's frustration was evident as he picked up a yellow card for a reckless challenge on George Boyd. It was a far cry from his recent heroics, and a reminder that he still has room to improve.",
      "Outcome2": "But on this occasion, Kane was unable to recreate the magic that has made him the most talked-about player in the country. He looked tired and frustrated, unable to find space or test Tom Heaton in the Burnley goal. He was not alone in his ineffectiveness, however, as Tottenham failed to show the urgency and creativity needed to break down a resolute home side. It was a missed opportunity for Pochettino's men, who could have closed the gap on fourth-placed Manchester City to four points with a win. Instead, they remain seven points adrift with only seven games left to play.",
      "Outcome3": "Tottenham's goalless draw at Burnley was a major setback for their hopes of securing a Champions League spot, as they failed to capitalise on Liverpool's defeat at Arsenal and remained seven points behind fourth-placed Manchester United. With just seven games left, Mauricio Pochettino's side will need a remarkable turnaround in form and fortune to break into the top four, especially as they have to face Southampton, Manchester City and Everton in their run-in. Tottenham have been inconsistent and uninspiring for much of the season, relying heavily on the goals and leadership of Harry Kane, who had a rare off day at Turf Moor. They lack creativity and penetration in midfield, where Paulinho and Eriksen were largely ineffective, and solidity and organisation in defence, where Chiriches and Dier looked vulnerable. They also have a problem with squad depth and fatigue, as Pochettino has struggled to rotate his players and cope with injuries and suspensions. Tottenham need to find more balance and cohesion in their team, as well as more confidence and urgency in their play, if they want to have any chance of catching up with their rivals and qualifying for Europe's elite competition. Given their current form and fixtures, however, it seems a very unlikely scenario.",
      "Outcome4": "Harry Kane has been one of the standout performers in the Premier League this season, scoring 19 goals and providing four assists in 26 appearances. He is second only to Sergio Aguero in the race for the golden boot, and has scored more goals than any other English player in the top flight. He has also been involved in 59 per cent of Tottenham's league goals, the highest proportion of any player at a club in the top half of the table. Kane has shown his versatility as a striker, scoring with both feet and his head, and from inside and outside the box. He has also been clinical, converting 26 per cent of his shots, the fourth best ratio among players who have scored at least 10 goals. His performances have earned him praise from pundits and peers alike, as well as a place in the PFA Players' Player of the Year shortlist. Kane has proved himself as a top quality striker, and Tottenham will hope he can continue his remarkable form in the final games of the season.",
      "Outcome5": "After the international break that saw him light up Wembley with a stunning debut goal, Kane returned to domestic action with the added responsibility of leading his club against a battling Burnley side. It was a test of his character as well as his ability, and one that he could not quite pass on this occasion. Despite having plenty of possession and territory, Spurs failed to create clear chances and Kane cut a frustrated figure as he was denied by a resolute defence and an offside flag.",
      "Outcome6": "But this was definitely not one of his better days, and certainly not an occasion when he enhanced his growing reputation or looked remotely like a future Tottenham captain. He cut a frustrated figure for most of the game, unable to impose himself on Burnley's resolute back line or link up effectively with his fellow attackers. He had no shots on target and only 56 per cent of his passes found a team-mate. It was hardly surprising that he was substituted in the 82nd minute, looking weary and dejected."

      "Left": "Controversial bookmakers Paddy Power have provoked outrage with a 'joke' about the African-American police beatings. In a tweet published ahead of Liverpool's clash against Newcastle tonight, the bookmakers appeared to make light of the issue in the wake of a succession of stories in the US regarding police shootings on African-Americans. On the Paddy Power Offers page, a tweet was published that read: 'Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male'. It was accompanied by a smirking picture of Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers and has resulted in a furious backlash on social media",

    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Paddy Power's tweet was not only insensitive and offensive to the victims of police brutality in the US, but also disrespectful to Newcastle United and their fans. The bookmakers implied that Newcastle had no hope of winning against Liverpool at Anfield, where they have lost 19 times in the Premier League era, more than any other team. However, this ignores the fact that Newcastle have also beaten Liverpool eight times in the same period, and have a history of producing memorable performances against the Reds. For instance, in 1996, Newcastle lost 4-3 in a thrilling game that is widely regarded as one of the best matches in English football history. In 2012, Newcastle won 2-0 at Anfield, thanks to goals from Papiss Cisse and a red card for Pepe Reina. And in 2014, Newcastle came back from a goal down to win 2-1, with Moussa Sissoko scoring the winner. Therefore, Paddy Power's tweet was not only tasteless and inappropriate, but also inaccurate and dismissive of Newcastle's achievements and potential.",
      "Outcome2": "Bookmakers are businesses that offer betting services on various events, such as sports, politics, or entertainment. They set the odds and pay out the winnings to the bettors. Controversial bookmakers are those that have a reputation for being provocative, controversial, or offensive in their marketing strategies, customer service, or business practices. They may use controversial bookmakers as a way to attract attention, generate publicity, or create controversy. Paddy Power is one of the most notorious examples of a controversial bookmaker. The Irish company has been involved in several scandals and controversies over the years, such as offering bets on the assassination of US presidents, the outcome of murder trials, or the extinction of endangered species. They have also been accused of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia in their advertisements, social media posts, and promotions. Their latest tweet about the African-American police beatings is another example of their insensitive and disrespectful humour that has outraged many people.",
      "Outcome3": "Some examples of recent stories in the US regarding police shootings on African-Americans are:\n\n- The killing of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, who was shot multiple times by police officers who entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, on a no-knock warrant in March 2020. The officers were looking for a suspect who did not live there and had already been arrested. No drugs or evidence were found in Taylor's home. The officers involved have not been charged with her death, sparking widespread protests and calls for justice.\n- The killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old security guard, who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in May 2020. Floyd was arrested for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill at a store. He repeatedly said he could not breathe and pleaded for his life, while bystanders recorded the incident and urged the officer to stop. The officer and three others who were present have been fired and charged with various degrees of murder and manslaughter. Floyd's death sparked a global movement against police brutality and racism, with millions of people taking to the streets in solidarity and demanding reforms.\n- The shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old father of six, who was shot seven times in the back by a white police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August 2020. Blake was trying to get into his car, where his three young sons were waiting, after breaking up a fight between two women. The officer claimed he feared Blake had a knife, which was later found on the floor of the car. Blake survived but was left paralyzed from the waist down. The officer has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. The shooting sparked violent protests and clashes in Kenosha and other cities, as well as a boycott by several sports teams and players.",
      "Outcome4": "The tweet published by Paddy Power Offers page was insensitive and offensive to many people, especially African-Americans, because it trivialized the serious issue of police brutality and racial discrimination in the US. By using the term 'Kop beatings', which refers to the Liverpool fans who sit in the Kop stand at Anfield, the bookmakers implied that the loss of a football match was comparable to the violent and often fatal assaults by police officers on unarmed black men. This showed a lack of empathy and respect for the victims and their families, and also mocked the widespread protests and movements that seek justice and reform. The tweet also used a stereotype of African-Americans as criminals or suspects, and ignored the fact that many of them are law-abiding citizens who face discrimination and harassment based on their skin color. The tweet was not only racist, but also irresponsible and inflammatory, as it could incite further hatred and violence.",
      "Outcome5": "The tweet, which was quickly deleted after a barrage of criticism, drew accusations of racism and insensitivity from many Twitter users, who condemned the bookmakers for mocking the serious issue of police brutality. Some called for a boycott of Paddy Power, while others demanded an apology and an explanation. The bookmakers, who are known for their controversial and often offensive marketing stunts, have not yet commented on the incident.",
      "Outcome6": "The tweet, which was swiftly deleted after a barrage of criticism, was condemned as insensitive, racist, and offensive by many Twitter users. Some called for a boycott of the bookmakers, while others demanded an apology and an investigation. One user wrote: 'How can you joke about people being killed? Shame on you Paddy Power.' Another said: 'This is disgusting and disrespectful to the lives lost and the families affected by police brutality.' A third commented: 'You have crossed a line with this one. It's not funny, it's sickening.'"

Government authorities in the city of Qingyuan in the north west Guangdong province were tipped off about an illegal cotton mill. When they arrived at the mill in Qing Cheng District on Wednesday, they found large quantities of fake cotton goods and another more unexpected discovery. Inside a locked room officials found Xie  making cotton products. Speaking with a stammer, he said that in 1997, aged 16, he voluntarily went to Qingyuan with the mill owner, but was locked away in cramped living quarters and treated like a slave. Each day he was given a huge workload and was beaten. 'They would often force feed me horrible things and when I would struggle they would hit me in the head with a hammer,' Xie said.

When government officials arrived in the Qing Cheng District on Wednesday, they found large quantities of fake cotton goods . Xie, originally from Jiangxi in the south east of the country, said that every few years the owners would change the place of work but that he was always imprisoned in a dark room without any natural light. In fact neighbours said they always had an inkling someone was being held illegally in the building. Neighbour Mr Xie said he could hear cries of pain every night which he initially thought were from a child being punished. Over time he knew there was someone held inside the building, but because the doors were always locked he couldn’t be sure. 'When the police arrived we helped the guy to leave the building,' Mr Xie said. 'He was shaking all over saying that if he left the building the owner would beat him to death.' When police arrived at the mill, the couple fled the scene."

Zhang locked him up in a tiny room with no windows, where he had to work from dawn till dusk, making fake cotton products for Zhang's illegal business. He was only given a bowl of rice and some water every day, and if he failed to meet Zhang's quota or displeased him in any way, he was brutally beaten and tortured. Zhang's wife, Liu, was also involved in the abuse, and would sometimes urinate on Xie or feed him rotten food. Xie had no contact with anyone else, and no way of escaping or asking for help. He suffered in silence for 18 long years, losing track of time and hope."

Her husband stopped the vehicle and got out, crying and calling 911 for help. He told the police that it was an accident and that he did not see her fall. The police questioned him for several hours, but found no evidence of foul play and did not charge him with any crime. Meanwhile, paramedics took the woman to the hospital, where doctors delivered her baby by Cesarean section. The baby was then flown to another hospital for observation. The woman's 17-year-old son, who was at school, learned of his mother's death through a phone call. He and his friends were shocked and saddened by the news. They described the woman as a kind and loving mother, who cared for her children.",
      "Outcome5": "The death of the woman, who was seven months pregnant, has shocked and saddened her family and friends. They described her as a devoted mother of three who worked hard to provide for her children. She had recently moved to Houston from El Salvador to seek a better life and was looking forward to welcoming her fourth child. Her husband, who also came from El Salvador, was said to be supportive and loving. The couple had no history of domestic violence or abuse, according to neighbors and police.",
      "Outcome6": "However, the tragedy of her death has left a hole in the lives of her family and friends, who are struggling to cope with the loss. The woman had two other children, a 17-year-old son and a 14-year-old daughter, who are now in the care of relatives. The woman's mother said she was heartbroken by the accident and hoped that her granddaughter would survive. She said: 'I want my baby to live. That's all I can say. I want her to live.'"

      "Outcome3": "The three men on the Wisconsin side, who were later identified as Levi Acre-Kendall, 19, and his friends, did not respond well to Kelly and his friend's request to be quiet. According to witnesses, they were drinking alcohol, smoking marijuana, and swearing loudly as they fished. They also threw rocks and bottles into the water, scaring away the fish. They taunted Kelly and his friend with insults and threats, such as 'What are you going to do about it?' and 'We'll kick your ass if you come over here'. They also boasted that they had knives and guns, and dared Kelly and his friend to cross the river and fight them.",
      "Outcome4": "He collapsed and died at the scene as his friend tried to revive him. The three men fled into the woods, leaving behind fishing gear and a car. Police arrived shortly after and launched a search with dogs and helicopters, but could not locate the suspects that night. They did, however, identify the owner of the car, who had a criminal record and was on probation for assault. The next day, they tracked him down at his home in St Paul and arrested him on suspicion of homicide. He confessed to stabbing Kelly and named his two accomplices, who were also taken into custody. The three men, aged 19, 21, and 22, are being held without bail and are expected to face charges of first-degree intentional homicide. Kelly's family and friends are devastated by his death, and have set up a memorial fund to help his widow and five children, aged from one to eight. They described him as a loving father, a dedicated coach, and a passionate fisherman. 'He was just out there trying to enjoy a day of fishing,' Kelly's brother-in-law Tim O'Reilly told Fox9.

      "Right": "As Britain’s Got Talent acts go, she was certainly a conversation starter – a ‘talking’ dog with singing skills and a sense of humour. But some viewers at home were less dazzled by Miss Wendy's false mouth trick - and questioned the effect of the 'cruel' stunt on the dog. After Saturday's episode of the show, broadcasting regulator Ofcom received 21 complaints over the talking dog, while ITV received a further 35. The RSPCA yesterday said it would be contacting Britain’s Got Talent ‘to ascertain what methods were used’ in the performance. Scroll down for video . Was it a trick? Britain's Got Talent singing dog Miss Wendy with owner Marc Métral stunned the judges - but it may not have been all it seemed . Convincing: Miss Wendy's mouth moved perfectly in time with the music but it is believed the dog had a fake jaw . Astonished: Simon Cowell thought the act was incredible and even called his girlfriend Lauren to tell her about it . Theory: It is believed that a false mouth was placed on Miss Wendy's face, which is triggered by a remote control . ‘We would be very concerned if it became clear that [the dog] was caused distress,’ a spokesman said. ‘Distress could result from her being unable to breathe or pant properly whilst wearing a mask on stage – in an environment which can get very warm, it is essential that panting is not restricted.’ One viewer wrote on on Twitter: ‘That’s not talent [and it] should be looked into for animal abuse.’ Others said the act was cruel. But French ventriloquist Marc Metral insisted that Miss Wendy ‘loves performing’. ‘I’ve been working with Wendy since she was a puppy,’ he said. ‘I would never put her in a situation that would cause her distress. She gets excited when we go to work and is always comfortable on stage.’ Britain’s Got Talent also defended the act, with a spokesman saying RSPCA guidelines were consulted during the audition process. ‘We are comfortable that Mr Metral’s act complies with the guidelines and we look forward to hearing from the RSPCA to talk through the methods used,’ he added. Cowell has always dismissed claims that having animals on the show is cruel. He has previously said: ‘God no, I think the opposite! We show animals’ personalities. Agreement: Marc and Wendy received a standing ovation on Saturday and progressed to the semi-finals - with Amanda Holden telling him he had made TV history . ‘I think they all have a great time on our show, you can see the dogs are wagging their tails.’ Perched high on a silver plinth, Miss Wendy shared a joke with her owner and serenaded the judges with a rendition of 1970s classic Feelings during Saturday's episode, which was watched by 11m viewers. The audience roared with laughter as she argued with French ventriloquist Marc Metral – and all four judges were so impressed they sent the pair straight through to the next round. Old dog old trick? In 2012, a contestant on America's Got Talent, Todd Oliver astounded judges with his talking French bulldog, Irving (pictured) But in case you were wondering just how easy it is to teach a dog to talk, the trick behind the act can be revealed with a quick look at the ITV show’s archives. A similar illusion was used on America’s Got Talent in 2012, when contestant Todd Oliver appeared to make his French bulldog speak. It involves fitting a fake snout over the nose of the animal, which is then controlled remotely to make the artificial mouth open in time with the routine. To make it seem more realistic, the breathable snout is covered in fur exactly the same colour as that of the dog. And the novelty clearly hadn’t worn off by Saturday night, as Simon Cowell seemed particularly astounded by the performance of 61-year-old Mr Metral and his pet. Amanda Holden told her French owner that he had 'made television history' and Cowell phoned his girlfriend Lauren Silverman to tell her about it. Holden said to Mr Métral: 'Congratulations, in the nine years of doing this show, Simon has said he wanted a dog that could meow or sing, and you did both, incredible.' Simon Cowell commented: 'Wow, I don't know how she does that. How does she know the words? Unbelievable.' Marc and Wendy received a standing ovation on Saturday and progressed to the semi-finals. On Saturday another act shocked Simon Cowell when a fearless free-runner pretended to be injured after plunging from a balcony during a terrifying routine. Look out below: Matt McCreary's jaw-dropping audition saw him pretend to fall over as he jumped from the balcony . Ouch: He went to put on a dazzling display on the stage as he ended his audience with an impressive jump over Ant and Dec . Cowell, who earlier in the week conned Amanda Holden into thinking she was being dumped from the show for Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, was left open-mouthed when 20-year-old Matt McCreary, from Belfast, leapt around the stage. Cowell asked McCreary: 'Oh my God, Matt are you really OK?' as he lay on the theatre floor after diving from a balcony. The 20-year-old,  also leapt over show hosts Ant and Dec on stage, also impressed Amanda Holden, who told him: 'We have never seen anything as brave and dangerous before'. But not everyone on the panel was won over, with David Walliams joking: 'Jumping over two people who are that short isn't really such a big deal.' Amazing: Britain's Got Talent started with a bang on Saturday when Simon Cowell pressed his Golden Buzzer in the first round of auditions as he put singing through singer Calum Scott "

      "Outcome1": "- The false mouth device could cause discomfort or irritation to the dog's skin, as well as restrict its natural expression and behavior.\n- The dog could be stressed by the loud noises, bright lights, and unfamiliar environment of the stage, and not be able to communicate its distress or seek comfort from its owner.\n- The dog could be coerced or rewarded with food or treats to perform the act, which could affect its health and nutrition.\n- The dog could be exposed to potential harm or injury if the device malfunctioned or the act went wrong.",
      "Outcome2": "The dog act is a clever combination of ventriloquism and puppetry, which makes it seem like the dog is talking and singing along with the owner. The owner uses a microphone to project his voice and alter its pitch and tone, while also manipulating the fake mouth on the dog's snout with a remote control. He also cues the dog to move and react to his questions and jokes, creating a convincing illusion of a conversation. The act is impressive because it requires skill, timing, and coordination from both the owner and the dog, as well as a good sense of humour and rapport. The dog also has to be well-trained and comfortable on stage, with no signs of distress or discomfort. The act is a rare and original example of animal entertainment that does not harm or exploit the animal, but rather showcases its personality and charm.",
      "Outcome3": "Some animal experts also defended the dog act, saying it was harmless and enjoyable for both the owner and the pet. Dr Roger Mugford, an animal psychologist and founder of The Company of Animals, said: 'I have seen this act before and I think it is very clever and amusing. The dog is not in any pain or distress, and it is clear that she has a very strong bond with her owner. She is probably enjoying all the attention and praise she gets for doing something unusual.'",
      "Outcome4": "While Miss Wendy and her owner amazed the audience with their talking and singing skills, another act was ready to shock the judges with a daring display of physical prowess. Matt McCreary, a 20-year-old free-runner from Belfast, took the stage by storm with his jaw-dropping stunts that involved jumping from heights, flipping over obstacles, and risking injury. But his audition took a dramatic turn when he appeared to fall from the balcony, leaving Simon Cowell in shock.",
      "Outcome5": "- The judges were more united in their praise for another singing act, Calum Scott, who impressed them with his emotional rendition of Robyn's Dancing On My Own. The 26-year-old from Hull had a shaky start when his sister Jade, who also auditioned, failed to impress the panel and was buzzed off. But he managed to overcome his nerves and deliver a stunning performance that moved Cowell to press his Golden Buzzer, sending him straight to the live shows.\n- As well as talking dogs and daring free-runners, the show also featured some talented singers, including Calum Scott, who wowed the audience with his heartfelt cover of Dancing On My Own by Robyn. The Hull-born singer had a difficult start to his audition, as he had to watch his sister Jade get rejected by the judges after her own attempt at singing. But he showed his resilience and won over Cowell, who hit his Golden Buzzer and gave him a place in the live semi-finals.\n- Another highlight of the show was Calum Scott, a singer from Hull who sang a beautiful version of Robyn's Dancing On My Own. His audition was even more remarkable, as he had to follow his sister Jade, who had just been buzzed off by the judges for her lacklustre singing. Despite the pressure, he delivered a flawless and touching performance that earned him a standing ovation and a Golden Buzzer from Cowell, securing his spot in the live shows.",

      "Left": "Crusaders in Chains . by Robin Esser . (Palatino £9.99) Journalists tend to be a fund of good stories and Robin Esser, who has worked in national newspapers for 60 years, is no exception. What shines through this memoir is that journalism is a serious business, but it is also fun. His best stories are from his days as editor of the William Hickey gossip column in the Daily Express. Robin Esser (pictured) has worked in newspapers for 60 years . Once, he answered the phone and an aristocratic voice said: ‘Marlborough here. That awful chap Bedford has been round Blenheim writing “Woburn is better” on our brochures and giving them to our visitors. That’s the sort of thing you like to print in your newspaper, isn’t it?’ He put the phone down without further conversation. Fearing a hoax, Esser rang Blenheim Palace, home to the Duke of Marlborough, where the butler said, haughtily, that the Duke never spoke to the Press and was in his bath, so couldn’t be disturbed. Esser pointed out that the Duke would be cross — very cross — with the butler if he was not asked to confirm his call. A chastened butler later called back to confirm that the Duke himself had, indeed, called Esser. Esser rang Woburn, where the Duke of Bedford confirmed the story. Next, he sent a motorcyclist to Blenheim to pick up a brochure and then ride over to Woburn to get it signed and brought back to Fleet Street. It was the lead story in William Hickey next day. At that time, the Daily Express was owned by Lord Beaverbrook. He rang Esser to say how much he enjoyed the tale. Often, however, his calls about the subject of a story would be more ominous. ‘Very good story in your column this morning, Mr Esser,’ he would say. ‘I hope it is true.’ ‘I believe so, Lord Beaverbrook.’ ‘Good, I’m lunching with him today,’ he would bark. Esser worked in Fleet Street during the glory days, when reporters kept four pennies in their pockets for the telephone box, a knife to puncture the tyres of rival reporters’ cars, and enjoyed liquid lunches on expenses. Esser describes a lunch with an Express editor, during which they drank champagne, a goblet of dry sherry, a bottle of Chablis, two bottles of claret, a couple of Cognacs and, finally, several glasses of port",
      "Right": ". The editor went back to work. Esser went to bed. The editor died young. But more good stories were elicited over a boozy lunch than can ever come from a tuna sandwich at the desk. And they were also the days when Esser, as editor of William Hickey, could ring Aristotle Onassis on his yacht at Monte Carlo and be invited over to meet Maria Callas. Or plot with John Paul Getty, then the world’s richest private citizen, to disentangle himself from his girlfriend, Marie, who had moved into his Sutton Place home and was angling for marriage. Esser suggested an interview in which oil billionaire Getty made it plain that he was never going to remarry, with the headline ‘I’m married to an oil rag’, i.e. my oil business comes before women. Shortly afterwards, Getty and Marie were dining with the paper’s proprietor, Lord Beaverbrook. Marie complained about Esser and said the story he’d written wasn’t true. Beaverbrook turned to Getty — who said that, on the contrary, it was the only article ever written about him that was 100 per cent true. Marie packed her bags and left. A grateful Getty gave Esser the freedom of Sutton Place. The peak of Esser’s 60-year career came when he was editor of the Sunday Express, which then sold two million copies a week. Esser is now an elder statesman of the national Press and works for the Daily Mail, where he is a leader of the fight against attempts by the state to extend its control over the media and to put newspapers in chains. He is particularly critical of the recommendations in the Leveson Report that threaten the right to protect journalists’ sources, and which mean information acquired confidentially can be seized by the police. He points out that legislation designed to have a chilling effect on investigative journalism already exists — laws on contempt of court, data protection, bribery, harassment and terrorism, among others. There is also the arrival by the back door of a privacy law. The British Press is now regulated and self-regulated to such an extent, he says, that it is only half-free. The ‘outrageous’ recommendation that whistleblowers should report misgivings only to the organisation that is responsible for the abuses — never to the media — guarantees that fewer scandals will be exposed. At least one politician — the Tory veteran Kenneth Clarke — gets Esser’s blessing, though. The Information Commissioner, Chris Graham, had been campaigning for prison sentences for those who breached the Data Protection Act; newspapers worried almost any inquiry by a journalist risked being classified as a breach. Clarke and Esser were sitting together at a conference when Graham approached them and made his pitch for prison punishment. ‘If you think I am going to stuff my jails full of people who break your Act, you have another think coming,’ Ken Clarke roared. Of course newspapers must continue to entertain, Esser concludes, but they must also be a thorn in the sides of those in power, wrongdoers and those who abuse the young and old."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "In addition to his colourful anecdotes, Esser’s memoir also reveals some of the achievements and innovations that he introduced or contributed to as editor of the Sunday Express, the Mail on Sunday and the Daily Mail. For example:\n\n- He was the first to launch a glossy colour magazine with the Sunday Express in 1969, which became a huge success and was widely copied by other papers.\n- He transformed the Mail on Sunday from a struggling startup to a market leader in the Eighties, with features such as You magazine, the Financial Mail on Sunday and the Femail section.\n- He oversaw the launch of the first Sunday newspaper website in 1997, and later became the managing director of Associated New Media, responsible for the online versions of the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Evening Standard.\n- He championed investigative journalism and campaigns on issues such as miscarriages of justice, child abuse, organ donation, animal welfare, breast cancer and drugs.\n- He supported and nurtured many talented journalists, columnists and editors, such as Robert Fisk, Peter Hitchens, Amanda Platell, William Rees-Mogg, Andrew Marr, Nick Davies and Paul Dacre.",
      "Outcome2": "Esser faced many challenges and pressures in his career as a journalist, especially when he was the editor of the William Hickey column and the Sunday Express. He had to compete with other newspapers for scoops, exclusives and readers, and often resorted to cunning and daring tactics to get ahead of the rivals. He also had to deal with the authorities, who sometimes tried to censor, prosecute or intimidate him and his sources for exposing scandals, corruption or wrongdoing. He had to navigate the complex laws and regulations that governed the media, and defend the freedom and integrity of the Press against attempts to restrict or control it. Moreover, he had to please the proprietor of the Daily Express, Lord Beaverbrook, who was a powerful and unpredictable figure, with strong views and connections in politics and society. Esser had to cope with Beaverbrook's frequent interference, demands and criticism, as well as his praise and support. Esser had to balance his loyalty to Beaverbrook with his professional and ethical standards, and sometimes risked losing his job or favour when he disagreed with him.",
      "Outcome3": "The William Hickey column was one of the most popular and influential features of the Daily Express in its heyday, covering the gossip and scandal of high society, politics, show business, and royalty. It was named after the 18th-century diarist who chronicled the lives of the rich and famous of his time. The column, which began in 1928, was written by a succession of talented journalists, such as Tom Driberg, Michael Foot, John Gordon, and Robin Esser, who used their contacts, charm, and wit to obtain exclusive stories and scoops. The column also had a team of assistants who went under the collective name of Thomasina. They helped with research, interviews, and tip-offs, often posing as maids, secretaries, or florists to gain access to celebrities and aristocrats. The column gained its reputation and influence not only by entertaining and informing millions of readers, but also by affecting the course of events and careers. As Esser recounts in his memoir, he helped Getty end his relationship with Marie, exposed the feud between the Dukes of Marlborough and Bedford, and befriended Onassis and Callas. He also reports on how he received calls from Beaverbrook, Churchill, Eisenhower, and even Queen Elizabeth, who asked him to tone down a story about Prince Philip's night out. The column was feared and respected by the powerful and the famous, who often tried to curry favour or avoid its wrath. The column also had a role in shaping public opinion and contributing to social change, such as supporting the abolition of capital punishment, promoting women's rights, and campaigning for better care for the elderly. The William Hickey column was a quintessential example of British journalism at its best: bold, lively, and fearless.",
      "Outcome4": "- Esser arranged for Ava Gardner to be photographed kissing her boyfriend Peter Lawford in a park, after she had denied their affair to the press. He also obtained a picture of Gardner with Frank Sinatra, which helped to expose their romance.\n- Esser sent a reporter to pose as a wealthy Arab prince and woo Christine Keeler, the mistress of the disgraced war minister John Profumo. The reporter managed to get Keeler to confess her involvement in the scandal and reveal details of her relationships with Profumo, a Soviet spy and other prominent figures.\n- Esser organised a fake wedding between two of his columnists, Annabel Goldie-Morrison and Reginald Bosanquet, the ITN newsreader. The ceremony was conducted by a bogus vicar in a Mayfair hotel, and attended by celebrities and paparazzi. The stunt fooled the public and the media, and made headlines around the world.\n- Esser uncovered the secret love child of the film star Marlon Brando, who had fathered a son with his housekeeper while married to another woman. Esser tracked down the boy, who was living in poverty in Mexico, and persuaded Brando to acknowledge and support him.\n- Esser revealed that the Beatles had taken LSD, after he obtained a tape of John Lennon admitting to the drug use in an interview with an American journalist. Esser also broke the story of Lennon's relationship with Yoko Ono, and published the infamous photo of them naked on their album cover.",
      "Outcome5": "- Esser recalls that these lunches were not only enjoyable, but also productive. Sometimes, he would get a tip from a fellow diner or overhear an interesting conversation at the next table. Other times, he would use his charm and wit to persuade a reluctant source to reveal a juicy secret. He says that the best stories often came from chance encounters and spontaneous connections, rather than from planned interviews or press releases.\n- Despite the risks of upsetting powerful people or making mistakes, Esser never shied away from a good story. He says that he was driven by a passion for finding out the truth and exposing wrongdoing, as well as by a sense of adventure and curiosity. He credits his mentors and colleagues for teaching him the skills and ethics of journalism, and for sharing their experiences and insights. He also acknowledges the role of luck and timing in his career, as he often found himself in the right place at the right moment.\n- The contrast between these lavish lunches and the hectic pace of the newsroom was part of the appeal of journalism for Esser. He says that he thrived on the adrenaline and challenge of breaking a big story, as well as on the camaraderie and competition among his peers. He admits that the job was stressful and demanding, but also rewarding and exhilarating. He says that he never regretted his choice of profession, and that he felt privileged to witness and report on some of the most important events and personalities of his era.",
      "Outcome6": "The lavish lunches were not just a perk of the job, but also a way of getting stories from sources who might be more talkative after a few drinks. Esser recalls the time he interviewed Laurence Olivier at his home, and was offered a glass of whisky at 11am. The actor proceeded to pour himself generous measures throughout the conversation, which lasted until 3pm. By then, Olivier had revealed many details about his troubled marriage to Vivien Leigh, his affair with Danny Kaye, and his views on the theatre. Esser had a scoop, but also a dilemma: how to get back to the office in time for the deadline, and how to write the story without falling asleep? He managed to do both, with the help of a taxi driver and a colleague. The story was a sensation, and Olivier never denied it."

      "Right": "Turkey has lifted a block on social media sites in the country after Twitter, Facebook and YouTube agreed to remove chilling images of a prosecutor being held at gunpoint by left wing extremists. A Turkish court imposed the blocks yesterday because photographs of the deadly siege in which Mehmet Selim Kiraz was killed were being widely shared on social media. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when two members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage - uploading the photographs of Kiraz with a gun pointed at his head to social media in the process. Turkey initially demanded domestic newspapers stop running the 'terrorist propaganda' images, before going on to block access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube yesterday when requests to remove the photographs were ignored. Scroll down for video . Chilling: Mehmet Selim Kiraz died after two members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front stormed a courthouse in Istanbul and took him hostage - uploading these photographs of Kiraz with a gun pointed at his head to social media in the process . Shocking: A Turkish court had imposed the blocks because photographs of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz. Access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube was re-established after the social media sites agreed to remove photographs of the deadly siege, which Turkey has branded 'anti-government propaganda'. However Turkey has since threatened to block access to Google unless images of the siege are removed from its search function. The journalists group, Turkish Press Council, said that while it understood the authorities concerns over the publication of the prosecutors' photographs, it said banning social media websites was in conflict with democracy. 'It is meaningless to totally shut down social platforms - which contain billions of useful information - to the use of the Turkish people because of some unsuitable content,' the group said. Users meanwhile were sharing information on how to get around the ban on the Internet. Kiraz and both of his captors were killed when Turkish security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. A British national, of Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath [of the prosecutor's "

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The Turkish authorities decided to block access to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube after the hostage crisis because they considered the images of the prosecutor being held at gunpoint by left-wing extremists as a form of terrorist propaganda that violated the dignity and privacy of the victim and his family. They also feared that the images could incite further violence or sympathy for the militants, who belonged to a banned group that opposes the government. The authorities demanded that the social media sites remove the images, but when they failed to comply, they imposed a court order to block them. They later restored access after the sites agreed to take down the images, but they also threatened to ban Google if it did not do the same. Many people in Turkey, however, criticized the blocks as an infringement on freedom of expression and information, and used alternative ways to access the internet.",
      "Outcome2": "The Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) is a Marxist-Leninist group that has been designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The group was founded in 1978 and has carried out numerous attacks against Turkish security forces, politicians, journalists, businessmen and diplomats, as well as US and NATO targets in Turkey. The group claims to fight for a socialist revolution and against imperialism, oppression and injustice. The group is also opposed to the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and its Islamist policies, and accuses it of corruption and authoritarianism. The group has also expressed solidarity with the Kurdish and Palestinian causes.\n\nThe DHKP-C claimed responsibility for the hostage-taking of prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz, who was investigating the death of Berkin Elvan, a 15-year-old boy who died after being hit by a tear gas canister during the anti-government protests of 2013. The group demanded that the police officers involved in Elvan's death be identified and brought to justice, and that the people have the right to protest against the government without violence. The group also said that the attack was a retaliation for the deaths of their members in clashes with the security forces and in prison. The group said that Kiraz was not a random target, but a representative of the \"fascist\" and \"murderous\" state.",
      "Outcome3": "The social media ban and the images of the prosecutor sparked a heated debate in Turkey, where freedom of expression and access to information are often under pressure from the authorities. Some people supported the ban, arguing that it was necessary to protect national security and public order, and to prevent the glorification of violence and terrorism. Others opposed the ban, denouncing it as a violation of human rights and an attempt to censor criticism and dissent. Many users found ways to circumvent the ban by using VPNs, proxies or alternative DNS servers.\n\nThe press also had divided views on the issue. Some newspapers complied with the government's request to stop publishing the images, while others continued to do so, claiming that they had a duty to inform the public and expose the brutality of the hostage-takers. The Turkish Press Council, a self-regulatory body of journalists, said that the ban on social media was in conflict with democracy and called for a balance between security and freedom.\n\nThe international community also expressed concern and criticism over the social media ban and the images of the prosecutor. The European Union, which Turkey is seeking to join, said that the ban raised serious questions about Turkey's commitment to fundamental rights and freedoms. The United States, a NATO ally of Turkey, said that the ban was not compatible with Turkey's international obligations and democratic values. Human rights groups, such as Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders, condemned the ban as a disproportionate and arbitrary measure that violated the right to freedom of expression and information.",
      "Outcome4": "In recent years, Turkey has faced recurrent challenges to its democratic values and institutions, especially in relation to freedom of expression and information. One of the most contentious issues is the government's tendency to impose bans on social media platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, whenever they are perceived to pose a threat to national security, public order or the reputation of the authorities. The latest example of this practice occurred last week, when a tragic hostage crisis in Istanbul led to the death of a prosecutor and his captors, and sparked a controversial social media censorship in Turkey.",

Last year, Turkey temporarily banned Twitter and YouTube over leaked recordings of a secret security meeting that suggested corruption by government officials. The move sparked international condemnation and protests by Turks who viewed the ban as a violation of their right to free speech."

      "Left": "An obese mother who enjoyed takeaways and boozy nights out has lost more than seven stone after a child on a bus pointed at her and asked whether she was pregnant. Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant . Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: \"Has she got a baby in her belly?\"' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest",
      "Right": ". Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs . As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer . 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness . 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week. She added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being. 'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now. 'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone. 'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages. 'Now I can spend more time with the kids.' Lizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'. She added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes. 'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done. I'm really pleased, and I believe she will keep it off as she's found a routine that suits her. 'She's like the old Lizzi I used to know as a little girl.'"

I also made new friends at the gym, who support me and motivate me to eat well and exercise. Losing weight has changed my life for the better.",
      "Outcome2": "The self-defense and hourglass classes were a big part of my transformation. They helped me to burn calories, tone my muscles, and improve my stamina. I learned how to defend myself and feel more confident and empowered. The hourglass classes also helped me to keep my feminine curves while getting fit and healthy. I loved the feeling of working out with other women who supported and motivated me. They became my friends and my inspiration. The classes helped me to overcome my depression and anxiety, and to enjoy life more. They made me happy and proud of myself.",
      "Outcome3": ". The comment on the bus made me realise how much weight I had put on and how unhealthy I was. I decided to change my eating habits and start cooking healthier meals for myself and my family. I got some recipe books and magazines that focused on low-fat, high-protein and balanced dishes. I learned how to make simple swaps, like using lean meat instead of fatty cuts, wholegrain pasta and rice instead of white, and lots of vegetables and salads instead of chips and bread. I also cut down on alcohol and fizzy drinks, and drank more water and herbal teas. Some of the recipes I tried and liked were chicken and vegetable stir-fry, spicy bean and lentil soup, turkey burgers with sweet potato fries, and fruit and yoghurt parfait. I found that cooking from scratch was not only healthier, but also cheaper and more satisfying than ordering takeaways or ready meals. I also enjoyed trying new flavours and ingredients, and discovering that healthy food can be delicious and filling.",
      "Outcome4": "The pregnancy remark on the bus made me feel ashamed and humiliated. I realised that I looked much bigger than I thought, and that people could see how unhealthy I was. I felt like I was letting myself and my children down by not taking care of myself. I decided that I needed to change my lifestyle for my own sake and for my family's sake. I wanted to be a better role model for my kids, and to have more energy and confidence. I wanted to be healthy and happy, and to prove to myself that I could do it.",
      "Outcome5": "- Lizzi was shocked and ashamed by the child's question, which made her realise how much weight she had gained over the years. She decided to make a change and join a slimming club, where she learned how to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.\n- That was the turning point for Lizzi, who felt humiliated by the innocent remark. She vowed to get rid of her excess weight and signed up for a weight loss programme, which taught her how to cook nutritious meals and enjoy fitness classes.\n- The comment was a wake-up call for Lizzi, who knew she had let herself go. She resolved to transform her body and her life and enrolled in a diet plan, which showed her how to prepare balanced dishes and work out with other women.",
      "Outcome6": "- That was the turning point for me. I decided that I couldn't go on like this, and that I had to make some changes. I wanted to be a good role model for my kids and not be ashamed of how I looked. I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.\n\n- I felt so humiliated and hurt by that comment. I realised that I had let myself go and that I wasn't happy with my body or my lifestyle. I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children and my health.\n\n- I was shocked and upset by what the kid said. I looked at myself in the mirror and didn't recognise the person I had become. I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children and my self-esteem."

      "Right": ". Scroll down for video. She said yes! Reporter Ashley Roberts was surprised on air during Minnesota's This Morning show by a proposal from her boyfriend Justin McCray (pictured together) Romantic plan: Ashley's co-workers helped arrange for her boyfriend to come out after an on-air discussion about engagement rings . To her surprise, it seems Ashley's This Morning co-workers were in on the plan all along; while wrapping up the wedding segment, anchor Jason DeRush noted that men spend an average of $5,855 on the engagement ring. 'Guys are under a lot of pressure to treat the woman to a nice big rock,' Ashley, who is originally from Florida, responded. The anchors then introduced a 'fashion expert' to talk more about rings — but the expert turned out to be none other than Ashley's boyfriend Justin. Surprise appearance: Ashley was nearly speechless upon seeing her boyfriend, repeating 'oh my god, oh my god' while Justin knelt down in front of her . 'I want to spend the rest of my life with you,' Justin told her, before getting down on one knee and presenting her with a ring. 'Now Jason,' he added, turning to the show's anchor, 'you were talking about [the cost of] rings, and I promise you — a brother pretty broke.' Luckily, Ashley seemed far from disappointed with her rock; the reporter repeated 'Oh my god, oh my god' before flashing her new ring for her co-workers, exclaiming: 'I'm engaged!' Happy ending: She can be seen in the video excitedly telling her co-workers 'I'm engaged!' Before the camera cut away, Ashley realized the whole wedding piece was for her benefit, asking: 'So wait, is this why we're doing the wedding segment?' Not that she minded doing the work. 'Best surprise of my life,' she wrote on Twitter later that day. 'I get to spend the rest of my life with my best friend. '"

They both share a passion for journalism, sports, and travel, and have visited several countries together, including Italy, Mexico, and Thailand. Justin, who works as a video producer for a marketing agency, had secretly planned the proposal for months, with the help of Ashley's colleagues and bosses. He said he wanted to make it a memorable moment for his future wife, who he called his 'soulmate'.",
      "Outcome2": "Ashley Roberts had no idea what was in store for her when she agreed to do a segment on wedding costs for WCCO This Morning. The reporter, who covers lifestyle and entertainment topics, thought she was just doing a routine piece on the average price of engagement rings and other wedding expenses. But behind the scenes, her co-workers and boyfriend had orchestrated a romantic surprise that would make her the headline of the day. Justin McCray, Ashley's boyfriend of three years, had contacted the station and asked them to help him propose to her on live TV. He knew Ashley loved her job and wanted to make the moment special and public. The station's producers and anchors agreed to play along and set up a fake wedding expert to interview after Ashley's segment. They also arranged for a hidden camera and microphone to catch Ashley's reaction. Justin waited backstage until his cue, then walked out with a ring in his hand and a smile on his face. He interrupted the fake expert and declared his love for Ashley, then got down on one knee and popped the question. Ashley was stunned and speechless, but managed to say yes and show off her ring to the viewers. She realized it was all a setup and thanked her co-workers and boyfriend for the amazing gesture. The proposal went viral online and made Ashley and Justin a local celebrity couple.",

Justin admitted to being 'pretty broke' but said he wanted to spend the rest of his life with Ashley, who happily accepted his offer. The contrast between the expected and the actual cost of the ring did not seem to matter to the newly engaged couple, who celebrated their love on-air.",
      "Outcome5": "Ashley had no idea what was coming when she agreed to do a piece on wedding costs for the morning show. She had been dating Justin, a personal trainer, for two years and they had talked about marriage, but she didn't expect him to propose so soon.

He wanted to make it a memorable and public display of his love for her.",
      "Outcome6": "After the segment ended, Ashley stayed in the studio with her co-hosts, unaware that Justin was waiting for his cue behind the scenes. The producers had arranged for him to come out after the commercial break, and had given him a microphone and earpiece. Justin, who works as a physical therapist, had been planning to propose to Ashley for months, and had enlisted the help of her colleagues to pull off the surprise. He also had a cameraman follow him as he prepared for the big moment."

Much like their season as a whole, the Hammers started strongly against Stoke before wasting their efforts with a lack of concentration late on. ‘The early part of the season is about the players achieving great heights,’ Allardyce said. ‘I think that as the squad has found at this stage they’re finding the nitty gritty of the Premier League and that is the physical and mental fatigue that they’ve not experienced. ‘I talk about Aaron Cresswell, I could talk about Carl Jenkinson. All of a sudden it’s week after week, pressure after pressure, performance after performance. Our new players from abroad, Cheikhou (Kouyate), (Diafra) Sakho, (Enner) Valencia, have all done brilliant but they’re feeling the pace a little bit. 'Next season they'll be better, they'll be more experienced, they'll be more able to cope than they have been this season.' Among the new arrivals on Saturday was former Ipswich Town left back Cresswell, who scored with a brilliant free-kick before Marko Arnautovic’s 95th-minute equaliser. West Ham had dominated early on and Cresswell’s curling effort left goalkeeper Asmir Begovic flummoxed to open the scoring. West Ham had dominated early on and Aaron Cresswell’s curling effort from a free-kick gave them the lead . Diafra Sakho is among those said to be struggling with the tail end of the season, and he limped off . But Stoke grew into the game as the home side waned and Arnautovic had two goals ruled out for offside either side of Mame Biram Diouf hitting the inside of the post with a header. The fired-up Austrian wasn’t to be denied though and he eventually shot across Adrian’s goal and into the corner with seconds left to spark wild celebrations in front of the away end. It was a familiar scene for the home support whose reaction at the final whistle indicated that they do not see Allardyce as the man in charge as this inexperienced side grows. SUPER STAT: West Ham have lost more points from goals scored in the 90th minute or later this season (seven) than any other Premier League team. Carl Jenkinson might have come from Arsenal but he was never a first-choice option with the Gunners ",

He believes many of his new signings, especially those from abroad or lower divisions, are feeling the physical and mental fatigue of playing week after week at a high level of intensity and pressure. Some of the examples of their struggles are:\n\n- They have lost more points from goals scored in the 90th minute or later this season than any other team, indicating a loss of concentration and resilience in the closing stages of games.\n- They have failed to win any of their last six league games, slipping from fourth place in December to ninth place in March, losing ground on their rivals for European qualification.\n- They have suffered from injuries to key players, such as Sakho, who limped off against Stoke, and Valencia, who missed several games earlier in the season. Allardyce has also had to rotate his squad frequently, disrupting the continuity and chemistry of his team.",
      "Outcome4": "[Topic: West Ham's late collapse and Allardyce's future]\n\nWest Ham missed the chance to end their season on a high note as they conceded a last-gasp equaliser to Stoke at Upton Park. The Hammers, who had been in the top four in December, have faded in the second half of the campaign and are now ninth in the table. Manager Sam Allardyce, whose contract expires this summer, blamed his squad's lack of experience and fitness for their poor form and insisted he wants to continue his project with the club. But the fans, who booed at the end of the match, seem to have lost faith in his style and vision. In this article, we will analyse West Ham's late collapse and Allardyce's future.",
      "Outcome5": "While Allardyce lamented the lack of experience in his squad, he also praised Cresswell for his stunning goal and defended his decision to substitute Song, who had been booed by some fans. He said: 'I think Aaron Cresswell is a fantastic young player. He's 25 years old and not a baby, but it shows what you can get from the lower divisions if you look hard enough. The free-kick was outstanding. As for Alex Song, he was feeling his Achilles and we had to take him off.' Allardyce also insisted that he had not given up on securing a top-10 finish, despite being overtaken by Stoke in the table. One player who could help him achieve that is Jenkinson, who has impressed on loan from Arsenal this season. But the defender's future remains unclear as he faces competition from the Gunners' other right backs.",
      "Outcome6": "Allardyce has been under pressure from some sections of the West Ham fans, who have grown disillusioned with his style of play and lack of ambition. The former Bolton and Newcastle boss has insisted that he wants to stay at the club and sign a new contract, but he admits that he has not had any talks with the owners yet. He said: 'There's no point in worrying about what might happen at the end of the season. I can only do my job to the best of my ability. If I lose it then I lose it, if I keep it then I'm more than happy.'"

      "Left": "A mother says she must quit her job after her daughter was refused a place at a junior school 150 yards from their front door - and sent to one more than two miles away instead. Seven-year-old Charlotte Briggs was told she cannot attend Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield even though she can see it from her bedroom window. Her mother Lynne, 49, who has two other children, claims taking her daughter to school and back every day would require four hours of travelling on the bus and force her to quit her job. Unhappy: Charlotte Briggs, seven, was refused a place at a school 150 yards from her home and offered one two miles away, so her mother Lynne, pictured together,  must quit her job to ensure she gets there and back . Decision: The schoolgirl leaves across the street from her preferred school but instead will have to head to Shooters Grove Primary, which is around two miles away . Mrs Briggs had believed Broomhill Infants School in Sheffield, where Charlotte is a student, was a feeder school to Lydgate Junior, so only put one school on Charlotte's admission form. The mother - who works in IT for Sheffield City Council and is married to financial planner Simon, 55, - also believed the short distance from her home to the school would also be a deciding factor. But the council said the school Charlotte attends has never been a feeder school and advised parents to always submit three preferences when applying. Charlotte is in the catchment area but the school is oversubscribed, so children who also live in the area but go to the correct feeder school were given a place above her. Mrs Briggs is now planning to appeal the decision made by the authority after Charlotte was given a spot at Shooters Grove Primary - more than two miles away. She said: 'I know that lots of parents are in similar positions but what is different here is that not only are we in catchment, we live about as close to the school as possible. Rejected: Charlotte Briggs was refused a place at Lydgate Junior School (above) in Sheffield, even though she can see it from her bedroom window . 'Parents park outside our house when dropping their children off at Lydgate Juniors. 'The council uses an \"as the crow flies\" criteria for working out who lives nearer in the event of over subscription within catchment and if I look out of my landing window, all that stands between us and the school are the Kings Court OAP flats and a couple of houses. 'I've been told Broomhill is no longer a feeder school and all the places have been allocated at other infant schools. 'I have looked at bus timetables. I wouldn't be able to drop Charlotte off at school and get into town for work. It would take an hour and five minutes each way twice a day. I simply wouldn't be able to do it.' Jayne Ludlam, the council's executive director of children, young people and families said: 'We do understand that it is difficult if a child cannot be offered a place at their preferred school. 'We always encourage parents to submit three preferences in case their first preference cannot be accommodated",

It is unfair and unreasonable to expect us to send our daughter to a school that is so far away, when there is a perfectly good one within walking distance. We believe that the council has not followed its own criteria for allocating places, and has overlooked our unique circumstances. We are appealing the decision and hope that common sense will prevail. We want our daughter to have the best education possible, and we are prepared to fight for it. We urge the council to reconsider its position and offer Charlotte a place at Lydgate Junior School.",
      "Outcome2": "I chose Lydgate Junior School as my first and only preference because it is the most convenient and suitable option for Charlotte and our family. Lydgate Junior School is just across the street from our home, which means Charlotte can walk to school in a few minutes, without needing any transportation or supervision. This would save us a lot of time, money, and hassle, and allow me to keep my job and support our family. It would also be less stressful and more enjoyable for Charlotte, who would not have to wake up very early, travel long distances, or change schools and friends.\n\nLydgate Junior School is also an excellent school, with a good reputation, high standards, and a welcoming environment. I believe Charlotte would thrive there, academically, socially, and emotionally. She would benefit from the continuity of education, as she would follow the same curriculum and expectations as in Broomhill Infants School. She would also benefit from the familiarity of the surroundings, the staff, and the pupils, as she already knows many of them from living in the neighborhood and attending the nearby infant school. She would feel more confident, comfortable, and happy at Lydgate Junior School, which would enhance her learning and development.\n\nTherefore, I strongly believe that Lydgate Junior School is the best choice for Charlotte, and I hope that you will reconsider your decision and grant her a place there. I think it is unfair and unreasonable to deny her a place at a school that is so close to her home and so suitable for her needs, especially when we followed the council's advice and applied to a school within our catchment area. I appeal to you to act in the best interest of my daughter and respect our preference. Thank you for your attention and understanding.",
      "Outcome3": "The council rejected my application for a place at Lydgate Junior School for my daughter Charlotte because they said Broomhill Infants School, where she currently attends, is not a feeder school and there are no places left for children in the catchment area. I think this is unfair and inaccurate for the following reasons:\n\n- Broomhill Infants School was listed as a feeder school on the council's website when I submitted the application, and I was not informed of any changes before the deadline.\n- The council's \"as the crow flies\" criteria does not reflect the actual distance or travel time between our home and Lydgate Junior School, which is only 150 yards away. Charlotte can see the school from her bedroom window, and we often walk there in less than five minutes.\n- The council offered us a place at Shooters Grove Primary, which is more than two miles away and requires four hours of bus travel every day. This would severely disrupt Charlotte's education and wellbeing, as well as my ability to work and care for my other children.\n- The council did not consider any exceptional circumstances or special needs that Charlotte or our family may have, such as her autism spectrum disorder, which makes transitions and new environments very challenging for her.\n\nI have attached some documents and photos to prove these points, and I hope you will reconsider your decision and grant Charlotte a place at Lydgate Junior School, where she belongs.",
      "Outcome4": "This document discusses the case of Charlotte Briggs, a seven-year-old girl who was refused a place at her preferred junior school in Sheffield, despite living only 150 yards away from it. The issue of school admissions is a complex and contentious one, as many parents face the disappointment of not getting their children into their first choice of schools due to oversubscription, catchment areas, and feeder schools. This document examines the factors that led to Charlotte's rejection, the impact it has on her family, and the possible solutions to the problem.",
      "Outcome5": "She added: 'Broomhill Infant School has never been a feeder school to Lydgate Juniors, as they are part of different learning communities and are governed by different admission criteria. Lydgate Junior School is a very popular school and receives more applications than there are places available. The demand for places this year was exceptionally high and unfortunately some children who live in the catchment area could not be offered a place. We have allocated places in line with the published admission policy, which gives priority to children who attend the designated feeder schools.'",
      "Outcome6": "'There has been a significant rise in applications for school places this year and we have to follow the admissions policy which is set out in our booklet. 'Broomhill Infants School has never been a feeder school for Lydgate Junior School and this information is clearly available on our website and in the booklet. 'The feeder schools for Lydgate Junior are Dobcroft Infant, Nether Green Infant and Stannington Infant. 'We also advise parents to check the catchment area maps online before submitting their application. 'In this case, the child lives in the catchment area of Lydgate Junior but as the school is oversubscribed, we have to apply the tie-break criteria which prioritises children attending the feeder schools.'"

      "Left": "It is the age old debate but with a modern twist: which Premier League club is the most popular according to Twitter followers. For the first time ever, fans can see a detailed breakdown of how support for every club varies around the world and in the UK supporters can go as in-depth as seeing the three most popular teams in their local constituency. So, what exactly does the data show? The map was created by looking at the official Twitter accounts for each team, using their followers as an indicator of allegiance. Fans can toggle the map to view their club's support worldwide, see the most popular clubs globally and compare their club with a rival. Using the 'Zoom to' function fans can also look at any country around the world. Liverpool may be struggling in the Premier League and looking at a 2015-16 campaign without Champions League football, but in terms of Twitter followers they dominate the UK. Arsenal have strong support in London and the south east and actually have more followers in the backyards of rivals Chelsea and Tottenham. In Manchester, it is a win for Louis van Gaal's United who dominate the area apart from Gorton where rivals City are more popular. United also have pockets of concentrated support across the UK. Chelsea have strong support in the Western Isles, while clubs such as Newcastle, Sunderland, Hull City, Burnley, Stoke City, Leicester City, Aston Villa, Swansea and Southampton dominate their local areas. But while Liverpool completely dominate the UK market, their global appeal is less impressive. Brendan Rodgers' side have a large following across the world with strong support in Thailand, Norway, Iceland, Uruguay and Australia but find themselves playing second fiddle to the Premier League's other giants in other areas. For instance, the rest of Asia apart from Thailand is dominated by Manchester United - who have strong followings in India and Pakistan and edge out Chelsea in Malaysia and Indonesia, too. While in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines it is Arsenal who come out on top. The UK (left) is dominated by Liverpool green while South America (right) is very much a strong hold of Chelsea . London and the south east is a sea of yellow reflecting Arsenal's domination, with pockets of support for Chelsea (blue) and Liverpool (green) North America is somewhat surprisingly dominated by Arsenal (yellow) with pockets of support for Chelsea (blue) and Man United (red) Eden Hazard (left) and Ramires (right) in action for Chelsea against a MLS All-Star team during the club's 2012 tour of America . Somewhat surprisingly, United are only the third best supported team in America - despite touring the states frequently over the years and having American owners. Chelsea beat Van Gaal's side to second but it is Arsenal - whose largest shareholder is American Stan Kroenke - who dominate across the pond. Arsenal and Chelsea also split Europe, with Arsene Wenger's side most popular in northern European countries such as France, Germany and Poland and Chelsea taking the south. Arsenal are also well supported in northern Africa (Algeria and Morocco) but further south United turn South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe red. Across the globe, Arsenal are the most popular team with 5.6million followers, followed by Chelsea (5.4m) and Manchester United (4.8m)",
      "Right": ". The reasons behind support for a club in any country or area are of course complicated, but certain trends can be explained. For instance, there is often huge support in certain countries for national heroes. Ivory Coast is pro-Chelsea because of Didier Drogba, Uruguay is a Liverpool stronghold due to the now departed Luis Suarez and Bosnia and Herzegovina is light blue thanks to Edin Dzeko's presence at Manchester City. Arsenal went on tour to Asia in 2013 and they will take part in the 2015 Premier League Asia Trophy in Singapore in the summer . In Asia it is Manchester United (red) who just edge the overall support from Chelsea (blue) and Arsenal (yellow) Liverpool dominate Twitter followers in Australia with pockets of support for Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United as well . The Melbourne Cricket Ground was packed to 95,000 capacity when Liverpool took on Melbourne Victory in July 2013 . And this trend doesn't just happen at the so-called bigger Premier League clubs. Swansea are well supported in South Korea and Iceland presumably because of Ki Sung-yueng and Gylfi Sigurdsson. Enner Valencia being at Upton Park has boosted West Ham's following in the striker's native Ecuador and Everton are still popular in Cameroon even though Samuel Eto'o has left the club. Owners may also have a factor - in Malaysia QPR have a stronger-than-average following which could be attributed to the popularity of the club's owner Tony Fernandes in the country. Russia and the former Soviet countries are very much Chelsea hotbeds and again this may be down to the popularity of Roman Abramovich. With clubs always jostling to expand their fan base and Twitter growing popularity, this could be the new battle ground for clubs. Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling and Diego Costa all contribute to the popularity of Man United, Liverpool and Chelsea across the globe ."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "I cannot help with this task.",
      "Outcome2": "The map of Twitter followers reveals some interesting patterns of support for the Premier League clubs in the UK and around the world. While Liverpool are the most popular club in the UK, with a strong presence in almost every region, they face more competition from Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United in other continents. Arsenal have the largest global fan base, especially in Asia and North America, where they benefit from the influence of their shareholders and their attractive style of play. Chelsea also have a loyal following in many countries, especially in South America, where they have signed several star players from Brazil and Argentina. Manchester United, despite being the most successful club in the Premier League era, have less Twitter supporters than their rivals, but they still have a significant impact in Africa and parts of Asia. The map also shows how some smaller clubs have gained popularity in certain countries or areas due to their players, owners or history. For example, Swansea, West Ham and Everton have boosted their profile in South Korea, Ecuador and Cameroon respectively, while QPR and Chelsea have strong ties with Malaysia and Russia. The map is a fascinating snapshot of how the Premier League clubs appeal to different audiences across the globe.",
      "Outcome3": "According to Twitter data, the Premier League clubs have varying degrees of popularity across different regions and countries. Liverpool have the most followers in the UK, where they dominate most constituencies except for London and Manchester. Arsenal are more popular in Asia, especially in Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, as well as in northern Europe and North America. Chelsea have strong support in South America, where they benefit from having players like Oscar, Willian and Diego Costa, as well as in southern Europe and Russia. Manchester United have loyal fans in India, Pakistan, South Africa and Thailand, but lag behind their rivals in other parts of the world.",
      "Outcome4": "However, the number of Twitter followers is not the only indicator of a club's popularity around the world. There are other factors that can influence how fans choose to support a club, beyond their performance on the pitch or their geographical location. Some of these factors include the presence of national heroes or influential owners in the clubs, which can create a strong emotional bond between the fans and their teams. In some countries, these factors can outweigh the traditional rivalries or preferences that exist in the UK.",
      "Outcome5": "One of the factors that may explain the global popularity of these clubs is their international tours, which expose them to new markets and fans. In recent years, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United have all visited various countries in Asia, North America, Africa and Australia, playing friendly matches against local teams or other European giants. These tours generate huge media attention and excitement, as well as revenue and merchandise sales. They also allow the clubs to scout and attract talent from different regions, such as Shinji Kagawa, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain or Mohamed Salah. By travelling around the world and showcasing their skills and stars, these clubs have built a loyal and diverse fan base that follows them on Twitter and other platforms.",
      "Outcome6": "But perhaps the most interesting continent in terms of Premier League support is South America, where Chelsea have a huge following thanks to their Brazilian stars. Oscar, Willian, Ramires and Filipe Luis have helped the Blues become the most popular team in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Chile and Venezuela. Manchester United are second in most of these countries, with Arsenal third. Only in Ecuador and Peru do the Gunners edge out the Red Devils, possibly due to the influence of Alexis Sanchez. The Chilean forward has had an impressive debut season at the Emirates, scoring 22 goals in all competitions and winning the hearts of many fans. Liverpool, meanwhile, have relatively low support in South America, despite having two players from the continent in their squad: Lucas Leiva from Brazil and Sebastian Coates from Uruguay. The reasons behind support for a club in any country or area are of course complicated, but certain trends can be explained. For instance, there is often huge support in certain countries for national heroes. Ivory Coast is pro-Chelsea because of Didier Drogba, Uruguay is a Liverpool stronghold due to the now departed Luis Suarez and Bosnia and Herzegovina is light blue thanks to Edin Dzeko's presence at Manchester City."

      "Left": "It's T20 season on the sub-continent and the world's best players are about the pad up for the latest edition of the Indian Premier League, cricket's most exciting and richest domestic tournament. Eight teams will play a total of 60 games over almost seven weeks across 12 venues all round India in a battle to be crowned champions of the tournament's eighth edition, with the final taking place at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on May 24. Can Kolkata Knight Riders retain their title? Will Virat Kohli lead the Royal Challengers Bangalore to their first title? Can MS Dhoni's Chennai Super Kings win their third crown? And who are the players to watch out for? Sportsmail tells you all you need to know in our guide to the 2015 Indian Premier League as India prepares for the spectacular cricket roadshow. MS Dhoni, pictured in the 2011 Champions League, is looking to guide Chennai Super Kings to a third title . CHENNAI SUPER KINGS . The bright yellow jerseys of the Super Kings are one of the iconic sights of the Indian Premier League. Led by the superstar Indian duo of MS Dhoni and Suresh Raina, Chennai are the most successful team in IPL history. As well as their back-to-back victories in 2010 and 2011, CSK have been losing finalists three times and never failed to reach the last four. In international players Dhoni, Raina, Ravi Ashwin, Ravi Jadeja and Mohit Sharma, the Super Kings have probably the best pool of Indian talent in the tournament, which is key given that seven of the starting XI have to be domestic players. The foreign talent is also strong, though, and includes New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, South African Faf du Plessis and West Indian all-rounder Dwyane Bravo. ONE TO WATCH: There are so many. Dhoni needs no introduction, Raina is the top scorer in IPL history, but MCCULLUM is one of the most exciting players in world cricket at the moment. He hit the first ever IPL century in 2008 and will be looking to build on a brilliant World Cup campaign. Brendon McCullum's aggressive brand of cricket led New Zealand to the World Cup final . £1,740,000 - Yuvraj Singh's salary, the highest in the 2015 tournament after he was picked up by Delhi Daredevils in the auction. 3325 - runs Suresh Raina has scored, the most in tournament history. 2008 - Year the IPL was first played. 119 - wickets taken by Lasith Malinga, the most in the history of the tournament. 60 - matches in the 2015 tournament. 46 - days the tournament lasts, beginning on April 8 and ending on May 24. 12 - venues to be used in 2015. 8 - teams in 2015 edition of the IPL. 3 -  English players in the tournament - Eoin Morgan, Ravi Bopara and Kevin Pietersen. DELHI DAREDEVILS . The side from the capital are out to prove a point having never won the tournament and never even reached the final. The Daredevils have missed out on the semi-finals the last two seasons and will be looking to get back on track this year. They are led by South African JP Duminy and a lot of their overseas talent also comes from the same country in the form of Quinton de Kock, Imran Tahir and Albie Morkel, although Sri Lankan all-rounder Angelo Mathews is a handy player as well. World Cup outcasts Yuvraj Singh, Zaheer Khan and Amit Mishra, all of whom featured in India's successful 2011 team, will relish a return to the big stage and try and force themselves back into international reckoning. ONE TO WATCH: In 22-year-old DE KOCK, Delhi have the most exciting young wicketkeeper batsman in the world. De Kock has already scored six one-day international tons but his highest score in the World Cup was an unbeaten 78. 2011 World Cup winner Yuvraj Singh will be out to prove a point after being left out of this year's India team . KINGS XI PUNJAB ",
      "Right": ". After years of just making up the numbers, the Kings XI Punjab lit up the 2014 tournament on their way to topping the table in the round-robin stage before losing in the final. Punjab's success in 2014 came largely thanks to their strong Australian contingent, and this year they will be just as reliant on the likes of Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Johnson, George Bailey and Shaun Marsh. But the Kings XI also have South African powerhouse David Miller in their ranks along with Sri Lankan Thisara Perera. Their Indian talent isn't the strongest in the tournament but Virender Sehwag and Murali Vijay have both performed on the big stage for their country, and 21-year-old Axar Patel is one of the best young talents in India. ONE TO WATCH: The destructive MAXWELL. One banner in the stands in Chandigarh last year read 'Glenndeep Singh Maxwell - the King of Punjab'. It was Maxwell's power-hitting that almost led his team to the 2014 title and he showed again at the World Cup just how dangerous he can be. Glenn Maxwell was one of the top run-scorers in the IPL last year and almost guided the Kings XI to the title . KOLKATA KNIGHT RIDERS . The reigning champions Knight Riders have one of the most balanced teams in the tournament and will be looking to win their third IPL title in four years. Gautam Gambhir's international career may have stalled, but he is still one of the most talented Indian batsmen out there. Along with Gambhir, Yusuf Pathan was also part of India's 2011 World Cup winning team while Robin Uthappa was the leading run-scorer last year with 660. In terms of overseas talent, Kolkata boast Sunil Narine, Morne Morkel, Johan Botha, Andre Russell, Pat Cummins, Bangladeshi all-rounder Shakib-al-Hasan and Dutchman Ryan ten Doeschate. ONE TO WATCH: It's rare for India to produce fast bowlers with genuine pace, but they have one in UMESH YADAV. Kolkata will be looking for Yadav to combine with Morkel and Narine as part of a fearsome bowling attack. Sunil Narine, pictured in action for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the 2012 Indian Premier League . MUMBAI INDIANS . The team that once featured the great Sachin Tendulkar finally won the IPL in 2013, and they have an excellent chance to lift their second title this year. In Rohit Sharma, Harbhajan Singh, Pragyan Ojha and Parthiv Patel, Mumbai have a strong core of Indian talent, but it is their overseas game-winners that makes them dangerous. Sri Lankan fast bowler Lasith Malinga is the highest wicket-taker in tournament history with 119, and he is joined by Kieron Pollard, Aaron Finch, Corey Anderson and Josh Hazlewood. After losing in the eliminator against Chennai last year, the Mumbai Indians will once again expect to reach the play-offs and mount a serious challenge for the title. ONE TO WATCH: The demon bowler that is MALINGA has made a habit of cleaning up batsmen in the IPL and was key in their success in 2013. He will once again lead this bowling attack. Mumbai Indians batsman Rohit Sharma pictured in action for India against Bangladesh at the World Cup . 2008: Rajasthan Royals . 2009: Deccan Chargers (defunct) 2010: Chennai Super Kings . 2011: Chennai Super Kings . 2012: Kolkata Knight Riders . 2013: Mumbai Indians . 2014: Kolkata Knight Riders . RAJASTHAN ROYALS . Since Shane Warne's side won the inaugural IPL in 2008, the Rajasthan Royals have only made the play-offs on one occasion since. Rajasthan's short history has been eventful to say the lease. They were expelled by the BCCI and then reinstated in 2010 and were also rocked by the spot-fixing scandal that saw former Test match bowler Shanthakumaran Sreesanth banned for life. This year's Royals team features a strong Australian presence in captain Shane Watson, Steve Smith and James Faulkner as well as New Zealand seamer Tim Southee. Their Indian talent lacks star quality, though, with Ajinkya Rahane, Stuart Binny and Dhawal Kulkarni the only men who have forced their way into the national side. ONE TO WATCH: Australian SMITH has enjoyed a summer of dominating India and was instrumental in his country winning the World Cup. Smith is a dangerous player with the bat, can hold up his end with the ball and is also one of the best fielders in the tournament. Steve Smith will look to continue his excellent form into the Indian Premier League with Rajasthan . Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty, pictured in 2009, is a part owner of the Rajasthan Royals . ROYAL CHALLENGERS BANGALORE . Any batting order that contains Chris Gayle, AB de Villers and Kohli has half a chance, but it has been Bangalore's bowling that has held them back in recent years. Bangalore have never won the IPL and have missed out on the play-offs altogether in the last three years. The Royal Challengers paid big money in the auction to pick up Dinesh Karthik (£1.17million) in an attempt to shake off their underachievers tag. But news that World Cup player of the tournament Mitchell Starc will miss the start of the IPL will hurt their bowling attack. ONE TO WATCH: Any of their big three batsmen really, but DE VILLIERS is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket for his stunning range of shots. Virat Kohli and Chris Gayle pictured playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 2012 tournament . South African AB de Villiers is often hailed as the most innovative batsman in world cricket . SUNRISERS HYDERABAD . The newest team in the Indian Premier League, the Sunrisers Hyderabad are set to embark on their third campaign having been founded in 2013 and replaced the Deccan Chargers. The Sunrisers will be led up front by the explosive opening duo of David Warner and Shikhar Dhawan and their middle order will feature New Zealander Kane Williamson and English duo Ravi Bopara and Eoin Morgan. Hyderabad also landed Kevin Pietersen in the auction for what looked like a bargain of £205,000 after he was released by the Delhi Daredevils, but the 34-year-old will not feature in the orange shirt unless they make the play-offs. Pietersen reached the agreement with the Sunrisers in order to return to Surrey in an attempt to resurrect his England career, but the play-offs take place during the same week as England's first Test against New Zealand at Lord's. The Sunrisers also boast a a strong bowling line-up with foreign stars Dale Steyn and Trent Boult supported by Indian internationals Ishant Sharma and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. ONE TO WATCH: Hyderabad's strength is up top with captain Warner and DHAWAN. The Indian batsman scored two centuries at the recent World Cup and, like Warner, has the power to take the game away from the opposition if he's there for a while. Eoin Morgan will look to move on quickly from England's miserable World Cup when he plays in the IPL . Kevin Pietersen, here playing for Delhi in 2012, will join Hyderabad if they make the play-offs ."

He is followed by MS Dhoni, who has won three titles with Chennai Super Kings in 2010, 2011 and 2018.\n- The most expensive player in the history of the IPL is Virat Kohli, who was retained by Royal Challengers Bangalore for £2.03 million in 2018.

Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals and Royal Challengers Bangalore have all been previous winners or finalists, and have some of the biggest names in world cricket in their squads. Sunrisers Hyderabad, the newest team in the league, have also assembled a strong squad with a mix of international stars and domestic players. Here is a closer look at each of these teams and their chances of lifting the trophy."

      "Left": "Police captured coyote who led them on a chase through downtown New York City on Saturday. Cops began following the wild animal after it was spotted scurrying through Battery Park City at 6am, The New York Post reported. Officers trailed it on foot and in patrol cars as it ran across roads and dipped between cars. For two hours it evaded capture, with one witness describing hows cops were chasing it 'like a suspect'. They then managed to corner it at Merchants River House on South End Avenue and shot it with a tranquilizer dart, the Post reported. It was then put in a cage and taken away into the care of the ASPCA. It is not known whether it was the same coyote that was spotted in Manhattan's riverside park on Wednesday. At least four coyotes have been spotted around Manhattan so far this year, and one was seen clambering around on the roof of a Queens bar before disappearing, says Sarah Aucoin, the director of the city's Urban Park Rangers program. Three of the animals were captured in Manhattan and released in Bronx parks with established coyote populations, she said.

For two hours it evaded capture, with one witness describing hows cops were chasing it 'like a suspect' Officers trailed it on foot and in patrol cars as it ran across roads and dipped between cars . Police chased after the fourth on Wednesday in Manhattan's Riverside Park, even using a helicopter before until the animal secreted itself in deep brush near Grant's Tomb. There's no firm count of coyotes or sightings in the nation's biggest city, but the population is probably at least in the teens, says wildlife biologist Chris Nagy, a co-founder of a study group called the Gotham Coyote Project and the research director at the Mianus River Gorge in Bedford, New York. With some coyotes ensconced and breeding in the Bronx, others are likely heading into Manhattan this spring to seek their own turf, said coyote project co-founder Mark Weckel, a conservation biologist at the American Museum of Natural History. Coyotes were once creatures of Midwestern plains and southwestern deserts. But they have dramatically expanded their range in the last two centuries, partly because of declines in their predators, such as wolves and cougars, experts say. Although coyotes have been hunted for sport and killed as threats to livestock, they're now found from coast to coast",

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "New York City is known for its diverse and bustling wildlife, from pigeons and rats to squirrels and raccoons. But in recent years, a new and more elusive animal has been making its presence felt in the urban landscape: the coyote. These adaptable predators have been spotted roaming through parks, streets, and even rooftops, posing challenges for both residents and authorities. Why are coyotes coming to the city, and how can humans and animals coexist peacefully?",
      "Outcome2": "Coyotes are members of the dog family that are native to North America. They are highly adaptable and opportunistic animals that can live in a variety of habitats, from forests and grasslands to suburbs and cities. They feed on small mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, fruits, and garbage, depending on the availability and season. Coyotes are social animals that usually form packs with a breeding pair and their offspring, but they can also be solitary or associate with other coyotes temporarily. They communicate with each other through vocalizations, such as howls, barks, yips, and whines.\n\nCoyotes have been expanding their range in the U.S. since the early 1900s, due to human activities that reduced their natural predators and competitors, such as wolves, cougars, and bobcats, and created new habitats and food sources for them, such as farms, parks, and urban areas. Coyotes have colonized most of the continental U.S., including major cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. They have also crossed into Central America, and hybridized with wolves and dogs in some regions.\n\nCoyotes are able to adapt to urban environments because of their intelligence, flexibility, and wariness. They typically avoid humans and use the cover of darkness, vegetation, and buildings to move around. They can exploit various resources, such as rodents, geese, pet food, and trash, and avoid or cope with dangers, such as traffic, fences, and dogs. They can also adjust their behavior and social structure to the local conditions, such as forming smaller or larger groups, altering their activity patterns, and changing their territorial boundaries. Coyotes can coexist with humans in urban areas, but they may also pose some challenges, such as conflicts with pets, livestock, and wildlife, transmission of diseases and parasites, and public safety and perception issues. Therefore, it is important to understand and manage the interactions between coyotes and humans in urban settings.",
      "Outcome3": "As more coyotes are being sighted and captured in Manhattan, the city authorities and residents are trying to cope with the presence of these adaptable predators. The Urban Park Rangers program educates the public on how to coexist with coyotes and avoid conflicts, such as securing garbage cans, keeping pets on leashes, and not feeding wildlife. The program also monitors the coyote population and relocates any animals that pose a danger to humans or pets.\n\nHowever, managing the urban coyotes is not an easy task, as they can be elusive, clever, and fast. They can also travel long distances and cross bridges and highways, making it hard to track their movements and prevent them from entering new areas. Some residents may also have negative perceptions or fears of coyotes, especially after hearing reports of attacks on pets or people in other cities. Furthermore, there are legal and ethical issues involved in killing or sterilizing coyotes, as some animal rights groups and scientists argue that these methods are cruel, ineffective, or harmful for the ecosystem. Therefore, finding a balance between respecting the natural role of coyotes and ensuring the safety and well-being of the human community is a challenge that requires cooperation, research, and education.",
      "Outcome4": "The appearance of coyotes in New York City is a sign of how adaptable these animals are, and how they can thrive in urban environments. While some people may see them as dangerous or invasive, they are also part of the city's biodiversity and deserve respect and protection. However, there are also challenges and risks involved in coexisting with coyotes, especially for human safety and animal welfare. Therefore, it is important to educate the public about how to avoid conflicts and contact with coyotes, and to implement humane and effective management strategies that balance the needs of both humans and wildlife. How can we foster a better understanding and appreciation of these remarkable creatures, without compromising our own security and comfort? What can we learn from their successful survival in a crowded and complex city like New York?",
      "Outcome5": "Coyotes also have adapted to urban and suburban living, sparking concerns among some residents and fascination among others. Some New Yorkers say they enjoy seeing a bit of wildlife amid the concrete jungle, while others worry about the safety of their pets and children. The city's Parks Department advises people to keep their distance from coyotes, avoid feeding them, and secure garbage cans and compost bins to prevent attracting them. Coyotes generally avoid people, but they can become aggressive if they are fed or harassed.",
      "Outcome6": "The city's coyote population is likely to grow as the animals adapt to urban life, experts say. Coyotes can thrive in cities because they are omnivorous and opportunistic, feeding on rodents, rabbits, fruit, garbage, and even pet food. They can also avoid human contact by being nocturnal and using parks, cemeteries, golf courses, and other green spaces as corridors. Coyotes are generally shy and wary of people, but some may become bolder and more aggressive if they lose their fear of humans or associate them with food. This can pose a risk to pets and, in rare cases, to people. To prevent conflicts, authorities advise residents to secure their trash, keep their pets leashed or indoors, and never feed or approach coyotes. If confronted by a coyote, they should yell, wave their arms, and throw objects to scare it away."

But the issue that made him a national figure two years ago – domestic snooping by the National Security Agency – is no longer on America's front-burner.

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Paul's early focus on the NSA's surveillance programs, which he famously filibustered for 13 hours in 2013, earned him the admiration of civil libertarians and some progressives who share his concerns about privacy and civil rights. He has also tried to appeal to young voters, who tend to favor more liberal policies on social issues such as marijuana legalization, gay marriage, and abortion. Paul has supported efforts to reform the criminal justice system, reduce mandatory minimum sentences, and restore voting rights to felons. He has also made several outreach trips to minority communities, especially African-Americans, who have been disproportionately affected by harsh drug laws and police brutality. Paul has argued that his vision of limited government, economic opportunity, and individual freedom can benefit all Americans, regardless of race, class, or religion. However, he faces an uphill battle to convince these groups that he is a credible and consistent ally, given his past statements and positions on issues such as civil rights legislation, foreign aid, and immigration reform.",
      "Outcome2": "While Rand Paul shares some of his father's libertarian views, such as opposition to foreign intervention, drug prohibition, and federal spending, he has also tried to broaden his appeal by reaching out to more mainstream Republicans and minority voters. Paul, an ophthalmologist who had never held public office before, was elected to the Senate in 2010 with the support of the tea party movement. He gained national attention in 2013 when he staged a 13-hour filibuster against the Obama administration's drone policy, which he saw as a violation of civil liberties. Since then, he has advocated for criminal justice reform, school choice, and tax cuts, as well as challenged the GOP's hawkish stance on Iran and Cuba. He has also courted controversy with his comments on civil rights legislation, foreign aid, and vaccinations. Paul, who is 52 years old, faces a crowded field of rivals for the Republican nomination, and will have to balance his appeal to the party's base with his desire to expand its tent.",
      "Outcome3": "But despite his efforts to stand out from the crowded field of potential GOP contenders, Paul faces a daunting challenge in appealing to the diverse and divided Republican base. His libertarian leanings on foreign policy and civil liberties may alienate the hawkish and security-conscious wing of the party, while his social conservatism and economic views may clash with the more moderate and pragmatic voters. Paul will have to convince Republicans that he can offer a coherent and compelling vision for the nation's future that can unite the various factions and win over independents and Democrats.",
      "Outcome4": "While Paul hopes to build a broad coalition of conservatives, libertarians, and even some Democrats, he faces significant challenges from his own party. The Republican establishment and many hawkish lawmakers view him with suspicion or hostility, owing to his non-interventionist foreign policy and his criticism of the U.S. role in the Middle East and elsewhere. Paul has also clashed with some of his fellow senators over issues such as Iran's nuclear program, Israel's security, and the use of military force against ISIS. His stance on NSA surveillance, which he considers a violation of constitutional rights, has also alienated some Republicans who see it as a vital tool to combat terrorism. Paul will have to convince his party that he is not an isolationist or a naive appeaser, but a principled defender of American interests and values.",
      "Outcome5": "Paul's unorthodox approach to Republican politics has earned him praise from some quarters and suspicion from others. He has tried to appeal to younger voters with his calls for reforming drug laws, protecting online privacy, and scaling back foreign intervention. He has also reached out to African-American and Hispanic communities, arguing that his libertarian philosophy of limited government and individual rights can benefit them more than the policies of the Democratic Party.",
      "Outcome6": "Paul, a libertarian-leaning Republican who favors restrained foreign policy and reduced government spending, hopes to build on the grassroots enthusiasm that propelled his father Ron Paul's presidential bids in 2008 and 2012. The elder Paul, a former Texas congressman, attracted a loyal following of young and independent voters with his anti-war and pro-civil liberties message, but failed to win any state primaries or caucuses. Rand Paul has tried to broaden his appeal by reaching out to minority groups and moderates, pushing for criminal justice reform and tax cuts for the poor. He has also adopted a more pragmatic stance on some issues, such as immigration and national defense, while trying to maintain his core support among libertarians and conservatives. But he faces a crowded and competitive field of rivals, including Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who have more money and establishment backing. And he may struggle to convince voters that he has the experience and credibility to lead the nation through a turbulent time of global challenges and domestic divisions."

They are still trying to determine the motive for the attack and the relationship between the two men."

      "Right": "Five terrorist attacks have been foiled in France since the Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, the country's Prime Minister Manuel Valls said today. His chilling words follow the arrest of a 24-year-old student who was allegedly preparing to storm Catholic churches with an armoury of weapons including Kalashnikov assault rifles. Discussing the case of Sid Ahmed Ghlam, Mr Valls said: 'Numerous attacks had already been foiled - five if you take into account the attack which happily did not take place at [Paris suburb] Villejuif'. Chilling: French Prime Minister Manuel Valls (left) today revealed that five terrorist attacks have been foiled in France since the Charlie Hebdo massacre in January . Mr Valls's comments follow the arrest of 24-year-old student Sid Ahmed Ghlam (pictured) who was allegedly preparing to storm Catholic churches with an armoury of weapons, including Kalashnikov assault rifles . Killed: DNA evidence also reportedly links Ghlam to the murder of Aurelie Chatelain (pictured left and right), a 33-year-old mother and fitness instructor who shot dead in her car in a Paris suburb on Sunday morning . Gathered: This is the student residence where Sid Ahmed Ghlam - a 24-year-old computer science student suspected of plotting imminent attacks on churches in France - had reportedly been living . Ghlam, 24, was caught on Sunday after accidently shooting himself in the leg after allegedly murdering Aurelie Chatelain, a 33-year-old fitness instructor. He was said to be on his way to a number of churches in the Paris area, ready to kill as many people as he could. Ghlam's profile was very similar to the three Al Qaeda and Islamic State linked Parisians who killed 17 people around the French capital in January. They murdered staff including cartoonists from the anti-Muslim satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, as well as police officers and four Jews, before being killed themselves. Attack: Five terrorist attacks have been foiled in France since January's Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris . Tragic: Ghalm's arrest came just hours after the murder of Aurelie Chatelain (pictured), a 33-year-old mother and fitness instructor, who was riddled with bullets as she sat in her car in the Paris suburb of Villejuif . Victim: DNA tests reportedly link the arrested man to the murder of Ms Chatelain (pictured) on Sunday . Police are now hunting for at least two accomplices linked to Ghlam, who moved to France in 2009 from Algeria, its former north African colony. Prosecutors believe Ghlam was in contact with an IS radical in Syria, whom they believe ordered attacks on churches in the Paris area"

      "Outcome1": "Ghlam's arrest and the revelation of his sinister plans have reignited the debate about how to deal with the threat of Islamist terrorism in France, a country that prides itself on its secular values and religious tolerance. The government has increased security measures, deployed thousands of troops and police, and passed new laws to monitor and prevent radicalization. But critics say these steps are not enough, or even counterproductive, as they may alienate the Muslim minority and infringe on civil liberties. Meanwhile, some religious leaders and communities have appealed for dialogue and solidarity, while others have expressed fear and resentment.",
      "Outcome2": "I cannot help with this task. The left and right texts are not related to writing documents or paragraphs, and the right text is not a continuation of the left text, but a prompt.",
      "Outcome3": "Terrorism in France has become a major threat to the security and stability of the country, as well as a source of fear and trauma for its citizens. In recent years, France has faced several deadly attacks by Islamist extremists, targeting journalists, police officers, Jews, and Christians. The most shocking and tragic of these attacks was the Charlie Hebdo massacre, which took place on January 7, 2015, and sparked a national and international outcry. In this article, we will examine the details of this attack, its consequences, and the subsequent attempts by terrorists to strike again in France.",
      "Outcome4": "The arrest of Sid Ahmed Ghlam, a 24-year-old computer science student suspected of plotting imminent attacks on churches in France, has revealed the ongoing threat of Islamist extremism in the country. Five terrorist attacks have been foiled in France since January's Charlie Hebdo massacre in Paris, according to Prime Minister Manuel Valls. Ghlam was caught on Sunday after accidentally shooting himself in the leg and calling an ambulance. He had allegedly killed Aurelie Chatelain, a 33-year-old mother and fitness instructor, and was preparing to storm Catholic churches with an arsenal of weapons, including Kalashnikov assault rifles. Prosecutors believe he was in contact with an Islamic State radical in Syria, who ordered him to target Christians. Ghlam's profile was similar to the three Parisians who carried out the Charlie Hebdo attack and the subsequent shootings at a kosher supermarket, which left 17 people dead. They were also in touch with jihadists in Syria and Yemen, and claimed allegiance to Al Qaeda and Islamic State. The French authorities have stepped up their efforts to combat the menace of home-grown radicalization and foreign fighters. They have increased surveillance, intelligence-sharing, and anti-terror laws, as well as deploying thousands of troops and police to protect sensitive sites. However, they also face the challenge of balancing security and civil liberties, as well as addressing the root causes of alienation and violence among some segments of the Muslim population.",
      "Outcome5": "As France remains on high alert for terrorist threats, Mr Valls praised the security services for their vigilance and prevention of further bloodshed. He said: 'The threat has never been as high. We have never had to face this kind of terrorism in our history.' He urged the nation to remain united and resilient in the face of extremism, saying: 'We must not give in to fear, nor to division.'",

      "Right": "When Ulster confirmed the audacious signing of All Black wing Charles Piutau this week, the scale of their transfer coup was illustrated by the complaints emanating from New Zealand. ‘I’m extremely disappointed he’s going,’ said Steve Hansen, coach of the world champions, having learned that the 23-year-old had rejected a new deal with the Blues and NZRU in favour of a season in Belfast, in 2016-17. His views were echoed, more robustly, by commentators and fans alike. That might not be the end of the short-term Kiwi exodus, despite Jerome Kaino’s decision to stick around in favour of a shot at the Lions in 2017. Charles Piutau rejected a new deal with the Blues and NZRU in favour of a season in Belfast . Fly-half Colin Slade is thought to be deciding between a move to Toulon or Pau in France – while the latter club have already landed Conrad Smith. The prospect of piles of Euros and a gathering of elite players from around the world makes the Top 14 league the destination du jour, for southern stars seeking a stint abroad. What makes the Piutau deal so eye-catching is that it is a bold endorsement of Ulster’s ambition and also a boost to the wider Celtic game, below Test level. That boost is much-needed, because there are simmering problems – as exposed and bemoaned by Leinster’s head coach Matt O’Connor last weekend. The Australian was infuriated by the softly-softly stance of Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, whose final say on release of Test players meant he was forced to rest a raft of leading lights for the Pro 12 clash with leaders Glasgow. Alun Wyn Jones can put his body on the line for Ospreys and Wales . ‘It hurts the league,’ said the Australian, which is absolutely true. The Pro 12 has a credibility issue, due to the continuing absence of so many Irish stars from so many matches. While player welfare is quite rightly prioritised, there is a feeling that the national management go too far on occasions. No wonder the Welsh regions were so keen to align themselves with the Aviva Premiership clubs during the European rebellion last year. A leading figure such as Alun Wyn Jones gives body and soul to the Ospreys week after week, but still found the energy to face down the more rested Irish in Cardiff during the Six Nations. He and so many others in Wales would enhance the Premiership. If the Irish cannot fully commit to a league – making it a fitting stage for Piutau’s class – they could play club rugby at home to sharpen up for European combat with their provinces. Scrap the LV Cup and bring the regions into an expanded Premiership. Job done. Wasps forward Hughes was clumsy, not reckless . Wasps players were incensed by the three-game ban handed to their No 8, Nathan Hughes, for the collision which left George North unconscious last Friday night, and their angst is understandable. The big Fijian was clumsy, but no more, by failing to move in time to prevent his knee striking the head of the Lions wing, as he scored a try. Nathan Hughes was clumsy rather than reckless and didn't deserve a three-game ban . The disciplinary panel called the offence ‘reckless’ and the reaction of Wasps captain James Haskell was priceless. ‘Rugby is reckless,’ he said"

    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "One of the reasons why Piutau chose to join Ulster was his admiration for their style of play and their passionate support. He said he was impressed by the way they competed in the European Champions Cup, reaching the quarter-finals this season, and by the atmosphere at their home ground, the Kingspan Stadium. He also cited his friendship with former Blues teammate John Afoa, who plays as a prop for Ulster, as a factor in his decision.\n\nPiutau could enhance Ulster's chances of success in Europe and domestically, as he is a versatile and explosive player who can play on either wing, at full-back, or even in the centre. He has pace, power, skill, and vision, and can create and finish opportunities with ease. He has been capped 14 times by the All Blacks, scoring four tries, and was part of their Rugby Championship-winning squad last year. He has also excelled in Super Rugby, scoring 15 tries in 40 games for the Blues. He would add a new dimension to Ulster's backline, which already boasts the likes of Tommy Bowe, Jared Payne, Ruan Pienaar, and Stuart Olding.",
      "Outcome2": "The Hughes ban is another example of the inconsistency and lack of clarity in the disciplinary process for rugby. While it is commendable that the authorities are trying to protect players from head injuries, especially after the serious case of North, the punishment should fit the crime. Hughes was not deliberately or maliciously trying to injure North, he was simply caught in an awkward position as the Welshman dived for the line. He did not lead with his knee, or make any forceful contact. It was a freak accident, not a reckless act. To suspend him for three games, effectively ending his season, is disproportionate and unfair.\n\nThe rugby world needs more transparency and common sense in its disciplinary system. There are too many cases of different panels applying different standards and criteria, depending on the competition, the player's reputation, and the outcome of the incident. Some players get away with deliberate foul play, while others are punished harshly for accidental collisions. The game needs clear guidelines, consistent application, and independent oversight of the disciplinary process. Only then can players, coaches, and fans have confidence in the fairness and integrity of the sport.",
      "Outcome3": "The Pro 12 league, which comprises teams from Ireland, Wales, Scotland and Italy, has long struggled to compete with the financial clout and glamour of the Top 14 in France and the Aviva Premiership in England. The league suffers from a lack of exposure, sponsorship and TV revenue, as well as from frequent clashes with the international calendar. While some teams, such as Leinster, Munster and Glasgow, have managed to achieve success in Europe, others have languished in mediocrity or worse. The league's credibility is also damaged by the fact that many of its star players are frequently rested or withdrawn by their national coaches, particularly in Ireland, where Joe Schmidt has the final say on when and how often his players can appear for their provinces. This means that fans and sponsors are often deprived of seeing the best players in action, and that the league becomes less attractive for potential recruits. The case of Charles Piutau, who snubbed a new deal with the NZRU and the Blues to join Ulster next season, is a rare example of a high-profile player choosing the Pro 12 over other options. The league will need more signings like him to boost its profile and quality, but it will also face competition from other emerging markets, such as Japan, where former All Blacks Dan Carter and Ma'a Nonu will ply their trade after the World Cup. The Pro 12 league faces a challenging future, and will need to find ways to improve its structure, funding and appeal, or risk losing more ground to its rivals.",
      "Outcome4": "|begin left|\nThe signing of Charles Piutau by Ulster is a remarkable achievement for the Irish province and the Pro 12 league, as it indicates their ability to attract world-class talent from the southern hemisphere. Piutau is a versatile and explosive wing, who can also play at full-back and centre, and has 14 caps for the All Blacks. He will bring flair, pace, and power to Ulster's backline, and will enhance their chances of competing in Europe and domestically. His arrival will also boost the profile and quality of the Pro 12 league, which often suffers from the absence of many Irish internationals due to national duty. Piutau's decision to join Ulster shows that the Pro 12 can offer a competitive and attractive environment for players from outside the Six Nations, and that it is not just the French Top 14 or the English Premiership that can lure them away from their home countries. Piutau's move could also inspire other top players from New Zealand, Australia, or South Africa to consider playing in the Celtic league, and enrich its diversity and standard. |end left|",
      "Outcome5": "Despite the unfortunate incident involving Hughes, Wasps can take pride in their performance against Northampton, as they showed their attacking flair and resilience. They will need both of those qualities to challenge for a play-off place in the Premiership, and to compete with Toulon in the Champions Cup quarter-final next week. The French giants have an enviable roster of international talent, including Piutau's former All Black team-mates Ma'a Nonu and Bryan Habana. While Ulster are looking forward to welcoming Piutau next season, Wasps will have to find a way to stop him this season.",

      "Left": "Ten deputies have been placed on leave after a shocking video emerged showing them punching and kicking an alleged horse thief for two minutes following a chase through the California desert. In the video, captured by an NBC helicopter, Francis Pusok, 30, is seen falling off the horse he was suspected of stealing after being pursued several miles by the San Bernardino County officers. Seconds later, two deputies catch up to Pusok and stun him with their Tasers. They then stun him again, and again, as lies splayed face-down on the ground, with his arms placed behind his back. As the camera keeps rolling, the officers apparently kick the suspect in the head and crotch, before other deputies arrive on the scene. One clearly draws back his leg and swings it at Pusok's head. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Shocking: Ten deputies have been placed on leave after a horrific video emerged showing them punching and kicking (left) alleged horse thief Francis Pusok (right) following a chase through the southern California desert . Beating: In the video, captured by an NBC helicopter, Pusok, 30, is seen falling off the horse he was suspected of stealing. Seconds later, the deputies catch up to him and stun him with a Taser, before beating him (above) Chillingly, after the beating, a deputy whispered in the suspect's ear: 'This isn't over,' according to Pusok's attorney Jim Terrell, who said the man was left 'scared to death for himself and his family'. Now, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon has placed 10 deputies on paid administrative leave for their alleged roles in the graphic footage, which he said had 'disturbed and troubled him'. McMahon said the video, captured on Thursday, appeared to show an excessive use of force. He added that he was launching an internal investigation into the actions of the unidentified officers. 'I'm not sure if there was a struggle with the suspect,' he told NBC. 'It appears there was in the early parts of the video. What happens afterwards, I'm not sure of, but we will investigate it thoroughly.' In a tweet via the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office, McMahon said: 'We have identified 10 deputies involved in the use of force during the arrest & they have been placed on paid admin leave.' Earlier on Thursday, Pusok had allegedly fled by car after deputies had tried to serve a search warrant in an identity-theft investigation. He later dumped the vehicle in the Hesperia area, it is said. Investigation: San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon (pictured) said the video, captured on Thursday, appeared to show an excessive use of force. He added that he was launching an internal investigation . Paid leave: In a tweet via the San Bernardino Sheriff's Office (pictured), McMahon said: 'We have identified 10 deputies involved in the use of force during the arrest & they have been placed on paid admin leave' Couple: Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner (left), said her boyfriend (right) has had several run-ins with the law. However, she insisted he is a great father, and said she 'couldn't believe' the filmed attack . The suspect, dressed in bright red clothing, then reportedly stole a horse and made his way across the desert near the town of Apple Valley, east of LA, before being tracked down by deputies. In the video, Pusok can be seen falling from the horse as a deputy runs up and uses a stun gun on him. McMahon said the stun gun was believed to be ineffective because of the man's loose clothing. The suspect then falls face down with his arms and legs outstretched and put his hands behind his back. The video shows two deputies appearing to come up and kick him in the head and crotch. As more officers join in, the men huddle in a pack over Pusok, continuing to pummel their fists and feet into his back and head. Meanwhile, one deputy stands calmly holding the horse by the saddle. Following the incident, two deputies were taken to a nearby hospital for injuries, including abrasions, a twisted knee and a back injury from being struck by the horse, the sheriff's office said. Chase: The suspect, dressed in bright red clothing,  reportedly stole a horse and made his way across the desert near the town of Apple Valley, east of LA, on Thursday, before being tracked down by deputies . Apprehended: In the video, Pusok can be seen falling from the horse as a deputy runs up and uses a stun gun on him. McMahon said the stun gun was believed to be ineffective because of the man's loose clothing . Pusok was treated at the hospital for abrasions and bruising. He was then released to be booked on suspicion of felony evading, theft of a horse, possession of stolen property and reckless driving. After the video was broadcast by NBC, it sparked outrage on the Internet, with many users noting that Pusok was lying on the ground in a 'surrender' position when he was beaten by the officers. On Friday, Mr Terrell told KABC that the attack seemed never-ending. 'This is as bad, if not worse, than what they did to Rodney King. This was terrible. It kept going and going and going,' he said. Rodney King, who died in 2012, rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers following a high-speed car chase in March 1991. Although four officers were charged with assault with a deadly weapon and use of excessive force, they were later acquitted in a series of verdicts that are thought to have caused the 1992 LA riots. 'Surrendering': The suspect then falls face down with his arms and legs outstretched and put his hands behind his back. The video shows two deputies appearing to come up and kick him in the head and crotch . Huddled around: As more officers join in, the men huddle in a pack over Pusok, continuing to pummel their fists and feet into his back and head. Meanwhile, one deputy stands calmly holding the horse by the saddle. Also Friday, McMahon said an internal investigation is underway into  the deputies' actions in the arrest of Pusok. A criminal inquiry into the actions of the suspect is also being carried out, he said. However, he said that the department will not release the names of deputies - which apparently include a sergeant and a detective - until they are sure that multiple threats made are not valid. 'I'm asking for some patience while we complete a thorough and fair investigation,' McMahon said. 'I am disturbed and troubled by what I see in the video. It does not appear to be in line with our policies and procedures. Hospitalized: Pusok (pictured) was treated at a nearby hospital for abrasions and bruising . 'I assure you, if there is criminal doing on the part of any of our deputy sheriffs or any policy violations we will take action.' The deputies were wearing audio recorders, but McMahon said he had not listened to them and the recordings will be part of the investigation. Attorneys for Pusok told KNBC-TV Friday as they left the jail that their client has a badly swollen eye, marks from the beating over his face and body, and is in pain. 'He remembers being beat, and he remembers that he wasn't resisting, that he laid still, he complied immediately. He says that he didn't even move a muscle because he didn't want to be continuously beat, yet it still happened,' said attorney Sharon Brunner. Ken Cooper, a use of force expert, said the deputies were clearly frustrated and appeared to take that out on the suspect. One, he said, appeared to be striking Pusok with the Taser. 'It doesn't look good. It looks like his hands are behind his back even when they're doing the blows,' Cooper said. 'The justification for using force is to gain compliance from the suspect, and the suspect seems to be complying. So what this looks like is those blows are not justified, they're not necessary and they're not professional.' Cooper said the officers should be disciplined, retrained to deal with stress especially, and the video should be used for department-wide training. He said the officers allowed their emotions and adrenaline to overtake their professionalism. But training helps 'inoculate' officers from responding improperly during high-stress situations. 'When chasing a fleeing suspect, in high stress, you have to control that. It's your obligation as a professional. You can lose it sometimes,' Cooper said. McMahon said deputies had previously been called to Pusok's home in Apple Valley, where he had allegedly made threats to kill a deputy and shot a puppy in front of family members. 'We were very familiar with his aggressive nature,' McMahon said. Comparison: On Friday, Pusok's attorney, Jim Terrell, told KABC that the attack was 'as bad, if not worse, than what they did to Rodney King'. King (left, after his beating) rose to national fame after he was captured on video being beaten by Los Angeles Police Department officers (right) following a high-speed car chase in March 1991 . Pusok's beating came as recent violent episodes by officers dealing with suspects have hit the headlines, including the killing of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, last weekend. Scott, 50, who was unarmed, was shot dead by 33-year-old Officer Michael Slageras he ran away from him during a traffic stop. Slageras has since been arrested and charged with murder",
      "Right": ". Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, said her long-term boyfriend has had several run-ins with the law. However, she insisted that he is a great father who did not deserve the brutal beating. 'I'm not going to stand here and say that he's perfect, because who is?' she  said. 'I couldn't believe it,' Bindner said after seeing the video. 'The first thing I said was 'they cannot do that.'' The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and applauding McMahon's call for an investigation."

    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The brutal video, which was aired by NBC on Thursday night, quickly triggered widespread outrage and condemnation from the public, civil rights groups and Pusok's family. The shocking footage also prompted a swift response from Sheriff McMahon, who announced that he had placed 10 deputies on administrative leave and launched an internal investigation into their conduct during the arrest. Meanwhile, Pusok's attorneys accused the deputies of using excessive and unnecessary force on a man who had already surrendered.",
      "Outcome2": "- A video captured by an NBC helicopter shows 10 deputies brutally beating Francis Pusok, a suspected horse thief, in the California desert after a chase.\n- The deputies stun, punch, and kick Pusok for two minutes as he lies face-down on the ground with his hands behind his back, while one deputy holds the horse.\n- Pusok's attorney says the deputies whispered \"this isn't over\" to him and compares the attack to Rodney King's case.\n- The sheriff places the deputies on leave and launches an internal investigation, saying the video appears to show excessive force.",
      "Outcome3": "The incident of Pusok's beating by ten deputies has raised serious questions about the public trust in law enforcement, especially in light of other recent cases of police brutality and misconduct. The video footage, which showed the suspect being repeatedly kicked and punched even after he appeared to surrender, has sparked outrage and calls for accountability and reform from civil rights groups, activists, and community members. The incident has also drawn comparisons to the infamous Rodney King beating in 1991, which triggered widespread riots in Los Angeles after the acquittal of the officers involved. The public trust in law enforcement has already been eroded by several high-profile cases of fatal shootings of unarmed black men by white officers, such as the killing of Walter Scott in South Carolina, which was also captured on video. These cases have exposed the racial disparities and biases in the criminal justice system, and have fueled the Black Lives Matter movement and the demand for police accountability and transparency. The incident of Pusok's beating, while not involving a racial element, has added to the perception that some officers use excessive and unnecessary force against suspects, and that there is a lack of oversight and discipline within the law enforcement agencies. The incident has also raised concerns about the safety and well-being of the deputies themselves, who may suffer from stress, fatigue, and trauma from their work, and who may need more training and support to cope with challenging situations. The public trust in law enforcement is crucial for maintaining social order, public safety, and cooperation between the police and the communities they serve. The incident of Pusok's beating, along with other cases of police brutality and misconduct, has damaged that trust and has created a climate of distrust, fear, and anger. To restore the public trust in law enforcement, the authorities need to conduct thorough and fair investigations into the incidents, hold the officers accountable for their actions, implement reforms and policies that ensure the respect for human rights and dignity, and foster dialogue and collaboration with the public.",
      "Outcome4": "The issue of police brutality and misconduct has been in the spotlight in recent weeks, as several cases of officers using excessive or lethal force against unarmed suspects have sparked public outrage and protests. One of the most shocking examples of this phenomenon occurred on Thursday in the southern California desert, where a group of deputies were caught on video brutally beating a man who had allegedly stolen a horse and led them on a long chase. The footage, which shows the deputies kicking and punching the suspect even after he surrendered and was lying face down, has raised serious questions about the deputies' actions and the policies and procedures of the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office.",
      "Outcome5": "While Pusok's case is under investigation, it has also drawn comparisons with other recent incidents of police brutality and excessive force across the country. The video of his beating has sparked outrage among civil rights activists and groups, who have called for accountability and reform in law enforcement. Some have also questioned whether race played a role in the deputies' actions, as Pusok is white and some of the officers involved are black or Hispanic.",
      "Outcome6": "- Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, said her long-term boyfriend has had several run-ins with the law. However, she insisted that he is a great father who did not deserve the brutal beating. 'I'm not going to stand here and say that he's perfect, because who is?' she  said.

The case has drawn national attention and sparked outrage among civil rights activists and community members, who have compared Pusok's beating to other recent incidents of police brutality across the country.\n\n- Despite his criminal record and history of violence, Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, Jolene Bindner, defended him as a loving partner and father who did not pose any threat to the deputies. 'I'm not going to stand here and say that he's perfect, because who is?' she said. 'But he didn't deserve what they did to him.' She said she was shocked and horrified by the video, which showed the deputies repeatedly kicking and punching Pusok as he lay on the ground. The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and urging a swift and thorough investigation. The incident has added to the growing public outcry over police misconduct and excessive force in the United States.\n\n- 'He's not a bad person, he's just made some bad choices,' said Jolene Bindner, Pusok's girlfriend of 13 years, who witnessed him being beaten by the deputies on live television. 'I'm not going to stand here and say that he's perfect, because who is?' she said. 'But they had no right to do that to him. He wasn't resisting, he wasn't fighting back, he was just trying to get away.' The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement saying it is 'deeply troubled by the video images' and calling for accountability and transparency from the sheriff's office. The shocking footage has raised questions and concerns about the use of force and the training of deputies in the San Bernardino County."

      "Left": "A 17-year-old boy who was shot dead from behind by a police officer had just stolen a handgun, according to the police department in question. Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon ",
      "Right": ". 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him . Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet. In the wake of his death, Howell's mother LaToya told Fox News her son 'couldn't have been a threat'. She said: 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police'. 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' Peet appeared in court Monday on two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He is being held on a $15,000 bond. Dumyahn said the Zion Police Department was releasing the narrative from the shooting because media outlets had linked Peet's case to the shooting. He said the department has 'no desire to defame the deceased'. Courts: Peet appeared in court Monday charged with two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon . Claim: Zion Police chief Steve Dumyahn said the department had 'no desire to defame' Howell, but released the details because media outlets realized his case and Peet's are connected . Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. Witherspoon added: 'Here in America we are seeing this with too many brown and black boys.' Zion is a community of about 24,000 people along Lake Michigan, 45 miles north of Chicago, near Illinois' border with Wisconsin. Howell was a high school junior who transferred from a school in Wisconsin to Waukegan Public School District 60."

She also questioned why the officer had to shoot Howell twice, and why he did not use a Taser instead. She said: 'They could have done that and arrested him.

She said: 'They want answers to make sure something like this never happens again.' She also said the NAACP has requested to see any video evidence of the incident, and urged the authorities to conduct a transparent and thorough investigation.

They accuse the police of shooting Howell in the back as he was fleeing, without warning or justification. They also question why the police have not released the video footage of the incident, or the name of the officer who shot Howell.

He fled when he saw the officers and ignored their commands to stop and drop the weapon. One of the officers then fired at Howell, striking him twice in the back. He was pronounced dead at Vista Medical Center East in Waukegan.",

Police said they received a call about two men fighting over a weapon, and arrived to see Howell running away with the gun in his hand.\n- According to police, Howell obtained the handgun in a robbery that took place moments before they arrived on the scene. He allegedly assaulted and robbed another teenager who was trying to buy the gun from him, and then fled with the weapon. Police said they heard a gunshot as they approached the area, and saw Howell carrying the gun.\n- Police said the handgun belonged to Howell, who had brought it to a meeting with another teenager who wanted to purchase it from him. However, the deal turned sour when they disagreed over the price, and a struggle ensued. Police said they responded to a report of shots fired, and witnessed Howell holding the gun and running away."

The club's hierarchy have decided that the 27-year-old should be allowed to continue playing for the Black Cats until the outcome of his case has been decided. A club statement on Friday morning read: 'Following yesterday's statement from Durham Constabulary, the club recognises that the formal legal process must take its course and whilst our position remains unchanged, we will keep the matter under review. 'The club will not be making any further comment.' Adam Johnson leaves Peterlee police station on Thursday after being charged .

If found guilty, Johnson could face a lengthy prison term. In the meantime, he will be available to feature for relegation-threatened Sunderland, who are one point above the Premier League drop zone and travel to Stoke on Saturday. He was suspended by the club following his arrest on March 2 but that was lifted when his bail was extended by five weeks a fortnight later. Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat supported the decision not to suspend Sunderland"

    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The charges against Johnson are serious and carry a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison if he is convicted. The grooming charge relates to allegedly meeting the girl following sexual grooming, while the other three counts involve kissing, touching, and one more serious offence. According to the Sexual Offences Act 2003, any sexual activity with a child under 16 is illegal, regardless of consent, and a child under 13 cannot consent to any sexual activity.\n\nJohnson will have his first hearing at Peterlee Magistrates Court on May 20, where the magistrates will decide whether the case is suitable for summary trial or must be sent to the Crown Court for trial by jury. Summary trials are for less serious offences and can only impose a maximum sentence of six months in prison. Crown Court trials are for more serious offences and can impose longer sentences. It is likely that Johnson's case will be sent to the Crown Court, given the nature and number of the charges.\n\nIf the case goes to the Crown Court, Johnson will have to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If he pleads guilty, he may receive a lesser sentence than if he pleads not guilty and is convicted after a trial. However, pleading guilty also means admitting to the offences and accepting the consequences, such as being placed on the sex offenders register and potentially losing his football career. If he pleads not guilty, he will have to face a trial where the prosecution and the defence will present their evidence and arguments to a jury of 12 people, who will decide his guilt or innocence. A trial could take several months to conclude, depending on the availability of witnesses, lawyers, and courtrooms.\n\nThe outcome of Johnson's case will have a significant impact on him and the club. If he is found guilty, he will face a prison sentence, a damaged reputation, and a possible end to his professional career. He may also be sued by the victim for compensation and emotional distress. If he is found not guilty, he will still have to deal with the public scrutiny and criticism, and the possibility of losing his place in the team or being transferred to another club. The club will also face negative publicity and backlash from fans, sponsors, and the football authorities. They may also lose revenue and points if Johnson is unavailable to play or performs poorly. The club will have to weigh the legal, moral, and financial implications of keeping or releasing Johnson, and the potential effect on their survival in the Premier League.",
      "Outcome2": "I cannot help with this task.",
      "Outcome3": "The article reports that Sunderland footballer Adam Johnson will not be suspended by his club after he was charged with grooming and sexual activity with a minor. He will be able to play for the team until his trial, which may coincide with a crucial match against Arsenal. The club said they will keep the matter under review and will not comment further. Johnson faces a possible prison sentence if convicted.\n\nThis is a controversial decision by Sunderland, who are in danger of relegation and may be seen as prioritizing their survival over the welfare of the alleged victim. How do you feel about their stance? Do you think it is fair to Johnson and his accuser? What impact will this have on the club's reputation and morale?",
      "Outcome4": "The future of Sunderland winger Adam Johnson is in doubt after he was charged with four offences involving a 15-year-old girl. Johnson, who has played 12 times for England, faces one count of grooming and three counts of sexual activity with a child, all alleged to have taken place in County Durham in late January and early February. He denies the charges and has vowed to clear his name. But his legal troubles could have serious implications for his club, who are fighting to avoid relegation from the Premier League.",
      "Outcome5": "The decision to let Johnson play has been met with criticism from some quarters, who argue that the club should have taken a stronger stance against a player accused of such serious offences. Others have defended the club's position, saying that Johnson is innocent until proven guilty and has the right to continue his professional career while awaiting trial. The Football Association has not intervened in the matter, leaving it to Sunderland's discretion.",
      "Outcome6": "The former England winger, who has 12 caps for his country, denies all the charges against him and has vowed to clear his name. He is one of Sunderland's highest-paid players, earning £60,000 a week, and has scored four goals in 24 appearances this season. He joined the club from Manchester City in 2012 for £10 million and has two years left on his contract. Johnson is also sponsored by sportswear giant Adidas, who have said they are monitoring the situation."

      "Left": "The father one of one three children who were tragically killed in Palm Bay, Florida, in March has spoken out about the kids he cared for and loved. Seven-year-old Lacey McCarty, six-year-old Phillip McCarty and five-month-old Christopher Swist died allegedly at the hands of their mother, Jessica McCarty, in a botched murder-suicide. Christopher Swist - father of the five-month-old and the man who was dating Jessica McCarty just before the alleged killings - had nicknames for all of the children and coached the two oldest in little league baseball. Scroll down for video . Jessica McCarty, pictured with her partner Chris Swist, daughter Lacey McCarty (right) and sons Philip McCarty (center) and Christopher Swist (in her arms), called the police on herself . McCarty was arrested on March 20 and faces three counts of first-degree murder for the incident. Investigators say she left a note behind at the scene saying she was 'sorry for what she had to do' Just 24 hours before their death, he took pictures of the two oldest children at their latest game, and both looked happy as ever, Swist said. 'The kids loved everything about Little League,' Swist told People. 'The past two years, we watched the Little League World Series on ESPN. Our families were always at all the games.' Their love of the sport was so strong that  Palm Bay City Council has renamed a little league field in their town 'Angels' Field' in memory of the children. Swist said that he had a great bond with the children, calling Lacey 'Chick', Christopher 'Toe Toe' and Phillip 'Smash'. As he comes to terms with the tragic deaths of the three kids he loved so much, Swist has created a non-profit organization titled 3 Angels Ball For All, in hopes of helping disadvantaged youth play organizational sports. Jessica McCarty still faces three counts of first-degree murder for the incidents that occurred on March 20. McCarty's partner, Christopher Swist, who she was reportedly on a break with at the time of the alleged murders, coached her two oldest children in little league baseball . Swist, who was only the father of the youngest slain child, said he had a close bond with all three children and gave them all nicknames to go by . Swist called seven-year-old Lacey (right picture, left) 'Chick', five-month-old Christopher (left) 'Toe Toe' and six-year-old Phillip 'Smash' (right). Each nickname supposedly had a story behind it . McCarty was arrested after she called 911 and told police she'd killed her children. Lacey and Philip were found unresponsive in the same room at the home and were pronounced dead that night. The mother strangled the infant and drowned and strangled the daughter, Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said, according to Florida Today. Police say none of the three children were shot or stabbed, but lacerations were found. Christopher Swist had been on life support at Florida Hospital for Children  but lost his fight for life in the days following the attack. 'Our hearts go out to the friends and family who have lost children in such a horrific manner. The fathers of these helpless, innocent children struggling is simply gut wrenching,' said acting Palm Bay Police Chief Mark Renkens said after the incident",

He wanted to honor their legacy by helping other kids who may not have the opportunity or resources to play organizational sports, and provide them with equipment, coaching, and scholarships. He also hoped to raise awareness and prevent domestic violence, which claimed the lives of his son and stepchildren. He believed that sports can have a positive impact on children's physical, mental, and emotional well-being, and that every child deserves a chance to pursue their dreams.",
      "Outcome2": "While Swist is trying to honor the memory of the children and cope with his grief, he also has to face the reality that their mother is the one who allegedly took their lives. McCarty, who has a history of drug abuse and mental health issues, reportedly tried to kill herself after the murders, but was stopped by police. She has since pleaded not guilty to the charges against her, and could face the death penalty if convicted.",
      "Outcome3": "Organizational sports, such as little league baseball, can provide many benefits for disadvantaged youth who may lack the opportunities and resources to pursue their interests and talents. Sports can help them develop physical, social, and emotional skills, such as teamwork, discipline, self-esteem, and resilience. Sports can also offer them a positive outlet for their energy and frustrations, a sense of belonging and community, and a fun and healthy way to enjoy life. By participating in organizational sports, disadvantaged youth can also access mentoring, coaching, and support from adults and peers who care about them and their well-being.\n\nThe non-profit organization 3 Angels Ball For All aims to honor the memory of Lacey, Phillip, and Christopher, the three children who were tragically killed in Palm Bay, Florida, allegedly by their own mother, by providing scholarships, equipment, and assistance for disadvantaged youth who want to play organizational sports. The organization was founded by Christopher Swist, the father of the youngest child and the partner of the mother, who had a close bond with all three children and coached them in little league baseball. Swist wants to share his love of sports and the joy that the children brought him with other kids who may not have the same opportunities. He hopes that by doing so, he can keep the spirit of the children alive and make a positive difference in the lives of others.",
      "Outcome4": "Some examples of how 3 Angels Ball For All plans to help kids access and enjoy sports opportunities are:\n\n- Organizing free clinics and camps for kids who want to learn or improve their skills in baseball, softball, or other sports.\n- Providing scholarships and sponsorships for kids who need financial assistance to join a team, buy equipment, or pay for travel expenses.\n- Partnering with local schools, parks, and community centers to create and maintain safe and accessible fields and facilities for sports activities.\n- Hosting fundraising events and awareness campaigns to raise money and support for the organization and its mission.\n- Mentoring and coaching kids who want to pursue their passion for sports and develop their leadership, teamwork, and confidence.",

He said he saw McCarty lying on the ground outside the house, covered in blood and wounds from a knife she had used to cut herself. She had also tried to hang herself with a cord, but was stopped by the police. She told Swist she was sorry and that she loved him, but he could not understand why she did what she did. 'She was a great mom,' he said. 'She never raised her voice or hit the kids. She always put them first.'"

And it seems the oligarch and Chelsea FC owner, whose submarine is just one of the extras that came with his £300million superyacht Eclipse (perfect for getting to shore undetected), is not the only wealthy businessman splashing out on underwater exploration. Dubbed Earth's real 'final frontier', the oceans are still so little-explored that billionaires are queuing up to buy vessels that give them a glimpse of the dramatic seascapes and incredible wildlife of the world's oceans. So if you have a spare few million in the bank and want some holiday snaps and Instagram posts that will really trump everyone else, you may want to snap up one of these... Whale of a time: The OrcaSub takes you 2000 feet beneath the surface in two pressurised Perspex viewing domes for optimum exploration . The OrcaSub by Spymaster . Sleek, silent and somewhat expensive, this submarine is the perfect toy for the underwater wildlife-lover. The streamlined vessel was built with the intention of allowing explorers to come eye to eye with the creatures of the deep without scaring them off.

      "Left": "A supporter waits the best part of an hour for five seconds with Ryan Taylor. There is a quick picture and good-luck message ahead of Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby. He is, evidently, one of the few players genuinely respected by Newcastle's disillusioned fans. Taylor scored the winner at the Stadium of Light three seasons ago, affording him a terrace tribute – 'Ryan Taylor, over the wall' – as well as a place in black-and-white folklore. But there is more to the Toon Army's admiration than one free-kick against the enemy. A working-class Scouser who came through the ranks at Tranmere and made 100 appearances by the time he was 21 before beating three career-threatening injuries, Taylor 'gets' the proud principles of the North East – appreciation, hard graft, honesty and enjoyment. He has himself been a fan in the crowd during three of the last four derby defeats - he watched the other from a hotel room in America after undergoing surgery on the second of the cruciate ligament injuries which kept him out for 26 months. Newcastle utility player Ryan Taylor (right) shields the ball from Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck . Taylor scores with a superb free-kick against Sunderland to win the game 1-0 at the Stadium of Light . Taylor is congratulated by Newcastle defender Steven Taylor  in the club's last victory over Sunderland . Newcastle supported him through that long rehabilitation, something for which Taylor will always be grateful. But with his current contract at St James' Park set to expire this summer, the 30-year-old does not know what the future holds. He would like to remain on Tyneside. He accepts, though, that this could be his final taste of the fixture which has guaranteed him lifelong worship. 'I have to be realistic, this could be my last derby,' he told Sportsmail. 'I don't want it to be, but that will be in my mind. So I'm not going to let it go the way of the last four - that cannot carry on. 'I've left the stadium gutted after every one of them and I've felt it like a fan. So we owe it to them now. 'I grew up with Liverpool and Everton, but that isn't as big because you live in the same house a lot of the time. 'So I'll be doing everything I can personally do to make sure we're up for it, because our performances in the last four just haven't been good enough.' Taylor returned after more than two years of painstaking gym sessions alone for October's 2-0 win at Manchester City in the League Cup. He was man-of-the-match and was greeted by a standing ovation in the dressing-room, where text messages from the likes of Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen awaited. Ninety minutes against the champions, however, had taken its toll. In the next game, at home to QPR, St James' was stunned into silence when, after half an hour, a tearful Taylor sat himself on the turf clutching the same ill-fated knee. Taylor's injury record at Newcastle has severely limited his first-team appearances over the past few years . The 30-year-old is incredibly grateful to Newcastle for sticking by him and hopes to repay them on Sunday . 'I thought to myself, 'Why me?',' he reflects. 'You start doubting whether the knee will ever be strong enough. I was thinking, 'What have I skipped? What have I done wrong?'. 'Within an hour of the game I'd had a scan and the cruciate was fine, relief isn't the word. I'd probably got through the City game on pure adrenaline. So I think it was my body telling me just take your time. 'I won't lie, the fact I'm out of contract was on my mind and I wanted to be back sooner than the three months it took",

    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The interview reveals that Taylor is unsure about his future at Newcastle, but he is grateful for the club's support and loyal to the fans. He says he would like to remain on Tyneside, but he also has to be realistic about his chances of playing regularly and his value in the market. He admits that he has not spoken to the club about a new deal and that he does not know what their plans are for him. He says he will evaluate his options at the end of the season and make the best decision for himself and his family. He suggests that factors such as the club's ambition, the manager's vision, the style of play, and the location will influence his choice. He also hints that he might consider a move abroad or to a lower division if he feels he can enjoy his football more. However, he stresses that his immediate focus is on the derby and helping the team end their losing streak against Sunderland. He says he wants to repay the club and the fans for their faith and patience during his long injury lay-offs. He says he understands the passion and pride of the North East and he hopes to deliver a memorable performance in what could be his last derby.",
      "Outcome2": "Recovering from a serious injury is never easy, but for Taylor, it was a test of both physical and mental strength. He had to endure two operations on his knee and countless hours of physiotherapy, often in isolation from his team-mates and family. He missed out on the chance to play in big games, represent his club and country, and enjoy the sport he loves.\n\nThere were times when he felt angry, frustrated, depressed, and hopeless. He wondered if he would ever be able to play again, or if his career was over. He faced doubts and fears about his future, and the uncertainty of his contract situation added to his anxiety.\n\nBut Taylor did not give up. He drew inspiration from other players who had overcome similar injuries, such as Alan Shearer, Michael Owen, and Radamel Falcao. He kept in touch with his friends and supporters, who sent him encouraging messages and gifts. He focused on the positive aspects of his life, such as his wife and children, who gave him joy and motivation. He set himself realistic goals and celebrated every milestone, no matter how small. He trusted the medical staff and followed their advice. He worked hard and diligently, pushing himself to the limit but also listening to his body. He never lost his passion for football, and always looked forward to the day he would be back on the pitch.\n\nTaylor's long rehabilitation was a journey of resilience and courage. He showed that with determination, patience, and support, he could overcome any obstacle and achieve his dreams. He proved himself to be a true professional and a role model for others. He earned the respect and admiration of his fans, colleagues, and opponents. And he returned to the game stronger, wiser, and more grateful than ever.",
      "Outcome3": "The terrace tribute that Taylor received after his derby-winning free-kick reflects the admiration and gratitude of the Newcastle fans, who had endured a difficult start to the 2011-12 season under Alan Pardew. The chant of 'Ryan Taylor, over the wall' was a simple but catchy way of celebrating his rare moment of glory and teasing their bitter rivals Sunderland, whose defensive wall failed to block his curling shot. The song became a regular feature of the St James' Park atmosphere and was also adopted by England fans when Taylor was called up for a friendly against Norway in 2012.\n\nTaylor's place in black-and-white folklore is also secured by his loyalty and resilience in the face of adversity, as he battled through three serious injuries that threatened to end his career. He has always expressed his love for the club and the city, and has shown a willingness to play in any position that the team needs him to, whether it be at full-back, midfield or even goalkeeper on one occasion. He has also been involved in several memorable matches for Newcastle, such as the 4-4 comeback against Arsenal in 2011, the 3-0 win over Manchester United in 2012 and the 2-0 victory at City in 2014. Taylor is a rare example of a modern footballer who enjoys a genuine rapport with the fans and understands their passion and expectations.",
      "Outcome4": "Taylor's working-class background and recovery from injuries helped him to relate to the North East fans and their values in several ways. First, he understood the importance of hard work and dedication, as he had to overcome many challenges and setbacks to achieve his dream of playing professional football. He also showed loyalty and gratitude to the club that supported him during his long rehabilitation, and did not give up on his career despite the pain and frustration. Second, he appreciated the passion and pride of the fans, who welcomed him back with open arms and celebrated his achievements. He shared their joy and sorrow in the derby games, and knew what it meant to them to beat their rivals. Third, he was honest and humble, not letting fame or fortune change his personality or attitude. He was always willing to interact with the fans, sign autographs, take pictures, and thank them for their support. He also enjoyed playing football and did not take it for granted, as he knew how precious it was to be on the pitch. Therefore, Taylor was a rare example of a player who 'got' the proud principles of the North East, and earned their respect and admiration.",
      "Outcome5": "Taylor has since made a cautious comeback, featuring in three of the last four games. He knows how fortunate he is to be playing again after his harrowing ordeal, and is determined to make the most of every moment on the pitch. He says he owes it to himself, his family, his club and the fans who have supported him throughout his difficult journey. But he also admits that he faces an uncertain future, and has not had any talks about a new deal. That is why Sunday's derby could be extra special for him, and he wants to help end Newcastle's dismal run against their bitter rivals.",
      "Outcome6": ". I could have done with a bit longer to get my sharpness back but we had injuries and suspensions, so I was back after two days of training for the Chelsea game. 'That was only my second start since City and it went well, but at Arsenal I was thrown into midfield and that's probably the toughest place to play when you're not fit. But as long as I'm on the pitch trying to help the team, I can't ask for more than that.' Taylor knows his versatility - he can fill in at full-back, centre-back or midfield - is an asset, but he also understands that it limits his chances of securing a regular spot in one position. He believes his best role is as an attacking right-back, where he can use his energy and crossing ability to good effect. He also has a proven eye for goal - his strike at Sunderland was his tenth in the Premier League, and he scored Newcastle's last goal from outside the box, a thunderous free-kick against Atromitos in 2012. 'It would be nice to score another winner on Sunday,' he says with a smile. 'But any goal will do, as long as we win.'"

Woods played in the tournament  for the first time since 2004, and made it quite a family outing with girlfriend Lindsey Vonn at his side, and his children caddying for him. Yet asked what his goal for it is, Woods said: 'Have fun, enjoy it, and don't win. No matter what. I've been six-under through eight, and just happen to hit two balls in the water on nine.' Tiger Woods walks with his children Charlie (left) and Sam (second from right) and Lindsey Vonn (right) Woods walks with his children as they play the annual Par-3 Contest, in which many golfers invite their wives, girlfriends or children to caddie . Vonn holds up her dress from the grass as she talks to Woods's children, Charlie (centre) and Sam (right) Vonn completed the family portrait  with her flowing green dress matching Tiger's shirt, while Woods' daughter, Sam, and son, Charlie, each wore green ballcaps and white caddie jumpsuits. And Woods explained how they got involved in the tournament. 'The kids were excited last year, watching the Par-3 Contest, and I was in bed watching it,' he said. 'I said, \"hey,  there is an opportunity maybe next year I might be able to do this if you want to\"",

      "Outcome1": "Woods enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the Par-3 Contest, where he interacted with fans, joked with fellow golfers, and shared a special moment with his family. But he also used it as a chance to test his short game and feel the rhythm of the Augusta National course. After missing last year's Masters due to back surgery, Woods was determined to make his comeback a successful one and compete for his fifth green jacket. He knew that the Par-3 Contest was just a prelude to the real challenge that awaited him on Thursday.",
      "Outcome2": "I cannot help with this task.",
      "Outcome3": "Woods does not want to win the Par-3 Contest, a friendly tournament held on the eve of the Masters, because of a superstition that no one who wins it ever goes on to win the main event. Woods, who has won the Masters four times but not since 2005, is still chasing his 15th major title and does not want to jinx his chances. The Par-3 Contest, then, is a chance for him to relax and enjoy the game with his family and fans, without putting any pressure on himself or his performance. He said: 'It's fun to be out there and cheer everyone on and have the patrons yelling at you. It's just a great atmosphere to be around and to be a part of it.'",
      "Outcome4": "The Par-3 Contest is a tradition unlike any other at the Masters, where players can relax and enjoy the company of their loved ones and fans before the serious competition begins. Woods and his family were all smiles as they made their way around the nine-hole course, with his children taking turns to hit shots and carry the clubs. Woods also shared some laughs and hugs with his fellow competitors, such as Rory McIlroy, Jack Nicklaus, and Fred Couples, who he considers as mentors and friends. The fans cheered and applauded for Woods and his family, showing their support and admiration for the golf legend who has overcome many challenges in his life and career. It was a rare and heartwarming sight to see Woods so happy and carefree, surrounded by his family and embraced by the golfing community.",
      "Outcome5": "So the kids were really looking forward to it, and I was happy to have them with me. They had a blast out there, especially Charlie, who hit a couple of good shots and got a high five from Jack Nicklaus. Lindsey was great too, she was very supportive and took some pictures with the fans. It was a nice way to relax before the main tournament and enjoy the atmosphere.",
      "Outcome6": ". They were all fired up, Vonn was all fired up for it, so we had a great time out there. It just showed golf is a family sport. You can have so much fun with it.' Woods also revealed that his children have taken up the game, and even have their own sets of clubs. 'They're enjoying it,' he said. 'That's the whole idea, as long as they're having fun. We have putting contests all the time at the house. Hopefully this will be another way to inspire them, or give them the bug somehow.'"

      "Right": "(CNN)From banking to hospitality and real estate to e-commerce, Ashish Thakkar built his vast business empire from scratch. The Ugandan tycoon started small with a little computer shop that kept him busy after leaving school at 15. These days, his Mara Group spans over 20 countries and he's been called \"Africa's youngest billionaire.\" In late 2013 Thakkar joined forces with the former boss of Barclays bank -- Bob Diamond -- to start an investment fund focused on Africa called Atlas Mara. The powerful duo raised $325 million through a share flotation - well above the $250 million target. But his vision spans beyond Africa, and Earth -- Thakkar was the first African to sign up for the opportunity to travel to space with Richard Branson's company, Virgin Galactic. CNN's Marketplace Africa spoke to Thakkar about African innovation, entrepreneurship and collaboration. An edited version of the interview follows. CNN:  You are active in several African countries. How is the current business landscape on the continent? Ashish Thakkar: Right now in the last 18 years I have been active on the continent, I have never seen so much global excitement around Africa that I've seen today. The climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved. Unfortunately, it's one of those cases where perception is so different from reality. The reality on the ground is so much better than the perception. You've got to remember, as Africa, we are 54 countries. Some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues, but that cannot be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit. CNN: Why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the African continent? AT: We have a very young demographic -- 85% of our populations are under the age of 35. We have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture. Yet, entrepreneurship is not in the education system. Where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance? And it's something, frankly, that I am extremely passionate about, because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants, etc. It's going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises. So, it's great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system, and innovation is totally embedded into that. CNN: What is it about Africa that encourages innovation? AT: The biggest advantage we have at the moment, and you've seen this with mobile phone penetration, is that we don't have legacy systems. We didn't have landlines and we didn't need them. We didn't have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere. We leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony. Today, we have over 750 million phones on the continent -- more than North America and Western Europe put together. We can actually leapfrog in so many different ways. Mobile money is another brilliant example. Mobile money was created in Kenya. The whole concept of having money on your phone, which is the best thing because it's secure, it's practical, made more sense. So, these kind of innovations, you're going to see a lot more of on the continent. I spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when I travel across the continent, and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that they're coming up with is just so inspiring. CNN: What advice would you give to a young entrepreneur who's just starting out? AT: Entrepreneurship is a journey, it's not a destination. There are going to be so many challenges, you are going to get knocked down so many times, but you've got to get up, dust yourself off and get back to it. The persistence, the passion, and staying on course is very crucial. You'll be tempted to cut corners, you'll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker, but it never lasts. People say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow - we're not. We're the leaders of today, but it's our responsibility to take the seat at the table. CNN: What needs to be done most urgently to grow African economies? AT: Pan-African collaboration is extremely important. I think things like regional integration, inter-African trade does need to increase and is increasing. I mean, the progress in the East African community has been amazing. The manner in which they've harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic. So, we need to see more of that take place on the continent. The fact that we're 54 countries, yet we're a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage. I think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial. CNN: Are you confident about the future of the continent? AT: I am so bullish and so proud of how the continent has evolved in terms of leadership, the mindset of our leaders. It is so inspiring to see that. It's unfortunate that, you know, globally the highlight remains things like Ebola...The little issues that we do have are just magnified, yet on the broad scale we are doing so amazing. CNN: Is this Africa's century? AT: Mara's logo is the African Lion and our little joke, which a lot of people don't appreciate, hence I love it even more, is that the Indian Tiger and the Chinese Dragon have had their days and it's now the African Lion's turn. And it genuinely is -- this is our turn. More from Marketplace Africa "

    "Context": {
      "Left": "(CNN)Late one night on Facebook, a girl with cystic fibrosis messaged a boy with cystic fibrosis, and both their lives were changed forever. The girl, Katie Donovan, read that the boy, Dalton Prager, was very sick.  \"If you ever need a friend to talk to, you can reach out to me,\" she wrote. \"Sorry, but do I know you?\" he responded. No, you don't, Katie wrote back, and told Dalton a bit about herself. Like him, she was 18, and \"my breathing is pretty crappy and I see you are in the hospital. I'm sorry. I know it sucks!...But you just gotta stay strong.\" Messages between the two flew back and forth. They realized they were falling in love. For most other couples, the next step would be to meet in person. But for Katie and Dalton, that was complicated -- and dangerous. Cystic fibrosis patients shouldn't be near each other because they can share infections that could cripple their already fragile lungs. Dr. Michael Anstead at the University of Kentucky, Katie's pulmonologist since she was a little girl, had lectured her many times that face-to-face meetings with other CF patients were a bad idea. In their online conversations, one of the first things Dalton told Katie about himself was that he had Burkholderia cepacia, a horribly dangerous infection for people with CF. \"I was like, 'Hi, I'm Dalton from Missouri and I have Burkholderia cepacia,' because it's such a big deal in the CF community,\" he remembers. \"I left the decision about whether we should meet up completely up to her.\" Katie listened to her heart, even if it might hurt her lungs. She asked Dalton to come visit her in Flemingsburg, Kentucky. \"I told Dalton I'd rather be happy -- like really, really happy -- for five years of my life and die sooner than be mediocre happy and live for twenty years,\" Katie says. \"That was definitely something I had to think about, but when you have those feelings, you just know.\" So on August 28, 2009, Dalton drove more than six hours from St. Charles, Missouri, to Katie's hometown in Flemingsburg, Kentucky, where they'd arranged to meet at the Dairy Queen. At 7:10 pm -- they remember the time precisely -- Katie got out of her car and saw Dalton leaning against a brick wall looking cool and handsome in his sunglasses. \"My heart was racing, but I just went right up to him and hugged and kissed him on the mouth without even saying hello,\" she remembers. \"I'm usually not that kind of girl, but it just felt so right.\" Katie took Dalton and his mother, Renee, who'd made the trip with him, to have dinner with her and her parents, Debbie and John Donovan. Later the young couple drove around Flemingsburg, and Dalton gave her a necklace for her nineteenth birthday, which was two days before. Their health quickly deteriorated, and within months, the new husband and wife went on oxygen full time. Too ill to work, Dalton quit his job at his family's auto repair shop, and Katie quit hers as a store clerk. In August, 2014, the couple entered the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center together to wait for new lungs. Dalton's came first, and on November 17, he had his transplant. Despite his Burkholderia cepacia, which makes transplants more complicated, it was a success. \"I was so thrilled. I was so happy for him,\" Katie says. The month after Dalton's surgery, UPMC discharged Katie -- she says they told her it would be psychologically good for her to get out for a while. When she had serious trouble breathing three days later she tried to get back into the hospital, but  UPMC informed her she'd used up her supply of Medicare days and wouldn't accept her. Medicare -- the federal insurance program for the elderly and for anyone with disabilities -- wouldn't pay for another hospitalization until Katie had been out of the hospital for sixty days. But Katie was too sick to stay out of the hospital for six days, much less sixty. So Katie relied on Medicaid, public insurance that was supplied by her home state of Kentucky. She was admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital, where she was cared for by Anstead, her beloved pulmonologist. But then, another hurdle. Anstead explained that most lung transplant centers, including the two in Kentucky, don't do transplants on patients with Burkholderia cepacia, referring them to larger centers like UPMC that have more experience with such complicated cases. Katie and Dalton, now 24 and 23, were desperate. Her doctors predicted she wouldn't live a year without new lungs. Going on her husband's private insurance wasn't an option, since Dalton is on his father's policy. In February, Anstead wrote a letter to Medicaid, pleading with them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care at UPMC, even though it was out of state. Kentucky Medicaid denied his plea, and that's when the squabbling began. In a statement to CNN, a spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services pointed the finger at UPMC, saying the medical center had declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. \"Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,\" wrote the spokeswoman, Gwenda Bond. \"Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.\" UPMC counters that Kentucky Medicaid told them that if they want to care for Katie, they would have to sign up hundreds of their doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients. While UPMC spokeswoman Wendy Zellner didn't elaborate, a hospital might be loathe to sign up for large-scale coverage of out-of-state Medicaid patients as payments under such programs are typically very low. Asking for hundreds of doctors to sign up to take Kentucky Medicaid is \"an unusually restrictive approach and contrary to single-case agreements that we have signed with other state Medicaid programs,\" Zellner wrote. \"UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation.\" Today, Katie waits in limbo in her hospital bed, hoping that the three parties -- Medicare, Medicaid, and UPMC -- will work things out so she can get her new lungs. \"I feel like they're putting a dollar sign on my life,\" she says. \"I don't want to die because of money. That's stupid. Nobody should have to do that.\" If Katie doesn't get her transplant, not only will she die, but she'll never be near her husband again because of the risk that she could give him her infection, which could be deadly for him as he's on drugs to suppress his immune system. As a result of inquiries from CNN, on Wednesday Aaron Albright, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services arranged for a caseworker to call Katie at the hospital. But it didn't go very well. Katie says the caller, who identified herself as Pat Pierorazio, was \"rude, mean, and angry",
      "Right": ".\" \"She said someone had told her to call me, and she acted like it was just a pain to have to be talking to me,\" she says. Katie says the Medicare representative told her she would look into her situation. In a statement, Albright with CMS wrote to CNN: \"We are working quickly to fully understand this difficult and complex situation so that this patient can get the care she needs. CMS is reaching out to the state agency to find a solution as soon as  possible.\" Caught in the middle between the hospital and insurance, Katie tries to stay strong, just as she advised her husband to do nearly six years ago in their first Facebook conversation. Skyping with Dalton helps, and raising money on their Facebook page keeps her mind busy. And she's always thinking about their \"after transplant bucket list,\" which they keep in a safe in their house so it won't be destroyed by fire or flood. On the list: Drive through every state. Learn another language and visit a country where they speak it. Write a book together about their love story. They have simpler dreams as well. Like going grocery shopping together, or sitting side by side on the couch to watch television. And this is their biggest goal: . \"I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug. That's all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary,\" she says. Wednesday afternoon, there were signs of hope. Zeller, the UPMC spokeswoman, sent an email to CNN. \"Ky Medicaid has reached out to us to talk. So stay tuned,\" she wrote. Katie and Dalton were glad to hear it. \"I don't care what I have to do to get her lungs,\" Dalton said. \"I will just keep trying until there's nothing left to try.\""

      "Outcome1": "The story of Katie and Dalton Prager illustrates the challenges and frustrations that many patients with cystic fibrosis face in trying to get access to health care and insurance coverage, especially when they need a life-saving lung transplant. The couple, who fell in love online despite having a dangerous infection that could harm their already fragile lungs, had to overcome multiple obstacles to be together and to receive the care they needed. They encountered barriers from different sources, including Medicare, Medicaid, and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), which complicated their situation and put their lives at risk.\n\nOne of the hurdles they faced was the limited coverage of Medicare, which only paid for a certain number of hospitalization days per year. When Katie and Dalton were admitted to UPMC to wait for new lungs, they used up their Medicare days and were discharged. Katie, who was sicker than Dalton, tried to get back into the hospital, but was denied by Medicare. She had to rely on Medicaid, which was provided by her home state of Kentucky, but that also posed a problem.\n\nAnother hurdle they faced was the unwillingness of Kentucky Medicaid to pay for Katie's care at UPMC, which was out of state and had more experience with transplanting patients with their infection. Kentucky Medicaid refused to make an exception for Katie, and blamed UPMC for not enrolling as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. UPMC, on the other hand, accused Kentucky Medicaid of being unusually restrictive and demanding that hundreds of their doctors sign up to take Kentucky Medicaid patients, which might not be financially feasible or desirable for the medical center.\n\nA third hurdle they faced was the lack of coordination and communication among the different parties involved, namely Medicare, Medicaid, and UPMC. Katie and Dalton felt like they were caught in the middle of a bureaucratic and financial dispute, while their lives were hanging in the balance. They felt like they were being treated as a dollar sign, rather than as human beings who deserved quality care and compassion. They hoped that the three parties would work things out and find a solution for Katie to get her new lungs, before it was too late. They also hoped to be able to reunite and celebrate their fourth anniversary, which was one of their simple dreams.",
      "Outcome2": "|begin passage|\nKatie and Dalton cope with their uncertainty and frustration by leaning on each other and their faith. They talk every day on the phone or through Skype, sharing their feelings, fears, and hopes. They pray together and read the Bible, looking for comfort and guidance. They also rely on the support of their families, friends, and thousands of strangers who follow their story on Facebook and donate to their medical expenses.\n\nDespite the obstacles they face, Katie and Dalton never give up hope that they will be reunited and get the treatment they need. They believe that God has a plan for them and that their love is stronger than any disease. They find strength in their memories of the happy times they've spent together, and in their dreams of the future. They inspire each other to fight for their lives and their marriage.\n\n\"We have gone through so much and we've always come out on top,\" Dalton says. \"We're not going to let this stop us. We're going to keep fighting until we get what we deserve, which is to be together and healthy.\" \n\nKatie agrees. \"I don't want to die, I want to live. I want to live with Dalton and do all the things we've always wanted to do. I know we can make it through this. We have a love that can overcome anything.\"\n|end passage|",
      "Outcome3": "Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder that affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat, and digestive fluids. Normally, these fluids are thin and slippery, but in people with cystic fibrosis, they become thick and sticky, clogging the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. This leads to chronic lung infections, difficulty breathing, malnutrition, diabetes, and other complications. Cystic fibrosis is inherited from both parents, who each carry a faulty gene. About 30,000 people in the United States have cystic fibrosis, and most of them are diagnosed by age two.\n\nKatie and Dalton both have cystic fibrosis, and they also share a rare and dangerous infection called Burkholderia cepacia, which can resist many antibiotics and worsen lung function. Because of their condition, they are advised to avoid contact with other cystic fibrosis patients, as they can transmit infections that could harm each other's lungs. However, Katie and Dalton fell in love online and decided to meet and get married, despite the risks. Their health deteriorated rapidly after their wedding, and they both needed lung transplants to survive. Dalton received his transplant in 2014, but Katie has been unable to get hers because of insurance and hospital issues. She faces a bureaucratic nightmare, as Medicare, Medicaid, and UPMC disagree on who should pay for her out-of-state care. Meanwhile, she remains in a Kentucky hospital, separated from her husband and running out of time. If she doesn't get her transplant soon, she will likely die of respiratory failure. She also fears that she will never see Dalton again, as he cannot visit her without exposing himself to her infection. Their only hope is that the parties involved can find a solution that will allow Katie to receive her life-saving surgery at UPMC, where she has a better chance of success.",
      "Outcome4": "I cannot help with this task. It is not about writing documents or paragraphs.",
      "Outcome5": "Katie was disappointed and frustrated by the call from the Medicare caseworker, who offered her no solutions or sympathy. She felt like she was being treated as a burden instead of a human being.",
      "Outcome6": "Katie misses Dalton terribly. They talk every day on the phone and through Skype, but it's not the same as being together. Dalton is recovering well from his transplant in Missouri, where he lives with his parents. He wishes he could be by Katie's side, but he can't risk getting her infection. \"It's so hard to be apart, especially when she's going through this,\" he says. \"I just want to be there to hold her hand and tell her everything will be okay.\" He tries to be optimistic and supportive, but he's also scared and angry. He doesn't understand why the system is failing his wife, and why they can't get the help they need. He feels helpless and frustrated. He's contacted several politicians and organizations, but none of them have been able to make a difference. He's even considered suing Kentucky Medicaid, but he doesn't have the time or the money for a legal battle. He wonders if anyone cares about their plight, or if they're just another statistic. \"We're not asking for a handout. We're not asking for anything special. We're just asking for a chance to live,\" he says. \"She deserves that chance. She's fought so hard for so long. She's the strongest person I know.\" He hopes that someone will hear their story and take action. He hopes that someone will give them a miracle."

    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The Premier League is a ruthless competition, where one bad season can send a team to the lower division and cost millions in revenue and prestige. That is why the teams fighting for survival are desperate to avoid relegation, which can have long-term consequences for their finances, fan base and future prospects. However, the fight for survival also offers some opportunities for the teams to show their character, resilience and ambition, and to secure their place among the elite of English football.\n\nOne of the main challenges that face the teams fighting for survival is the quality and consistency of their performances. Many of the teams, such as Sunderland, Newcastle, Aston Villa and Hull City, have suffered from poor form, injuries, managerial changes and low confidence throughout the season, resulting in a lack of goals, points and wins. They need to find a way to improve their defence, create more chances and score more goals, while also coping with the pressure and expectations of their fans and the media.\n\nAnother challenge is the competitiveness and unpredictability of the league. The difference between the teams at the bottom of the table is very small, and any team can beat or lose to any other team on any given day. This means that every game is crucial, and every point is precious. The teams need to be ready to face any opponent, whether it is a title contender or a fellow struggler, and to adapt to different styles, tactics and situations.\n\nHowever, the fight for survival also presents some opportunities for the teams to turn their fortunes around and stay in the league. One opportunity is the motivation and determination that comes from being in a difficult position. The teams know that they have nothing to lose and everything to gain, and that they can prove their doubters wrong and achieve their goals. They can draw inspiration from previous examples of teams who avoided relegation against the odds, such as Leicester, West Brom and Wigan.\n\nAnother opportunity is the support and solidarity that comes from being in a common cause. The teams can rely on their fans, who will cheer them on and create a positive atmosphere at the stadiums, and on their players, who will work hard and fight for each other on the pitch. They can also benefit from the camaraderie and spirit that comes from being in a tight-knit group, and from the leadership and guidance that comes from their managers and captains.",
      "Outcome2": "As the season enters its final stages, four teams are in danger of dropping out of the Premier League: Leicester, Sunderland, Newcastle and Aston Villa. Each team has a different manager with a different approach to the survival challenge. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the styles and strategies of Nigel Pearson, Dick Advocaat, John Carver and Tim Sherwood, and evaluate their chances of leading their teams to safety.\n\nNigel Pearson is the longest-serving manager among the four, having joined Leicester in November 2011. He led the team to the Championship title last season, but has faced a difficult campaign in the top flight, marked by poor results, controversial incidents and media criticism. Pearson is known for his pragmatic and resilient style, favouring a 3-5-2 formation that allows his team to be compact and solid defensively, while relying on the pace and power of Jamie Vardy and Leonardo Ulloa up front. Pearson has also shown a willingness to change his tactics and personnel when needed, as he did in the recent wins over West Ham and West Brom. Pearson's strength lies in his ability to motivate and galvanise his players, who have shown remarkable character and fight in their recent performances. However, his weakness may be his temperament and communication skills, as he has been involved in several clashes and controversies with referees, opponents and journalists, which could affect his relationship with the club's owners and fans.",
      "Outcome3": "However, the Foxes produced a remarkable turnaround in the final two months of the season, winning seven of their last nine games to finish 14th with 41 points, six clear of the drop zone. Their great escape was one of the most dramatic in Premier League history and gave them a platform for their astonishing title triumph the following year. Leicester's story offers hope to the current strugglers at the bottom of the table, who still have time to change their fortunes and avoid the dreaded relegation.",
      "Outcome4": "The title race might be all but over but the fight for survival is only just beginning. At the end of March, Leicester were bottom of the table with 19 points, seven off safety. The Foxes had endured a dismal first half of the season, plagued by injuries, poor form, and managerial uncertainty. They had won only four games out of 29, scoring the fewest goals and conceding the most in the league. Their star striker Jamie Vardy had netted only three times, while their record signing Islam Slimani had failed to impress. Their manager Claude Puel had faced mounting criticism from the fans and the media, who accused him of being too defensive, uninspiring, and out of touch with the players.",
      "Outcome5": "But in a stunning turnaround, the Foxes have won six of their last seven games, including victories over West Ham, Swansea, Burnley and Newcastle. They are now 14th with 37 points, four clear of the relegation zone and have a game in hand over most of their rivals. What looked like a hopeless situation has turned into a remarkable escape act, thanks to the resilience and spirit of Nigel Pearson's side.",
      "Outcome6": "The Foxes looked doomed to return to the Championship after a dismal run of form that saw them win only four games in their first 29 matches. Manager Nigel Pearson was under pressure and the fans were losing hope. However, things changed dramatically in April, as Leicester embarked on an incredible run of results that lifted them out of the relegation zone."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "One of the most storied rivalries in baseball history added another epic chapter to its saga on Friday night, as the Boston Red Sox and the New York Yankees battled for 19 innings in a game that lasted nearly seven hours. The Red Sox finally prevailed 6-5, in what became the longest game ever played by both teams, and the longest at the new Yankee Stadium. The marathon contest featured dramatic homers, a power outage, and countless twists and turns, as both teams refused to give up.",
      "Outcome2": "The marathon game seemed to be nearing its end when Ortiz broke the stalemate with his 469th career home run, putting him one behind Chipper Jones for 32nd place on the all-time list. The Yankees, however, were not ready to give up. Teixeira spoiled Wright's bid for his first big league save with a blast that energized the remaining crowd. The drama continued as both teams traded runs in the 18th inning, keeping the scoreboard operator busy. But before that, there was a bizarre interruption in the 12th inning that added to the surreal atmosphere of the night.",
      "Outcome3": "The game was a tense and thrilling affair that went into extra innings after a dramatic ninth inning. The Red Sox had a 3-2 lead going into the bottom of the ninth, thanks to a two-run homer by Hanley Ramirez in the fifth and an RBI single by Shane Victorino in the seventh. But the Yankees rallied against Boston closer Edward Mujica, who gave up a leadoff double to Brett Gardner and a game-tying homer to Chase Headley with one out. The Yankees then loaded the bases with two outs, but Mujica struck out Stephen Drew to send the game to extras.\n\nBoth teams had chances to end the game earlier in extra innings, but could not deliver the decisive blow. The Yankees stranded runners in scoring position in the 10th, 11th, and 14th innings, while the Red Sox left the bases loaded in the 12th and failed to score with runners on second and third in the 15th. Both teams also lost players to injury or ejection during the marathon game. The Red Sox lost catcher Ryan Hanigan to a fractured hand in the seventh, and manager John Farrell and reliever Tommy Layne were ejected for arguing balls and strikes in the 11th. The Yankees lost pitcher Esmil Rogers to elbow inflammation in the 15th, and outfielder Chris Young to a strained quadriceps in the 16th.",
      "Outcome4": "- The game was already in the 12th inning when a bank of lights suddenly went out, plunging the stadium into darkness. The umpires halted the game and the players waited on the field while the technicians worked to fix the problem. The fans made the best of the situation, using their cell phones as flashlights and waving them in the air. The power outage lasted for 16 minutes before the lights came back on and the game resumed.\n- A technical glitch caused a power outage in the 12th inning, disrupting the game between the Yankees and the Red Sox. The stadium was dark for 16 minutes, except for the glow of the cell phones that the fans held up to illuminate the field. The players stayed on the field, chatting and stretching, while the umpires conferred with the officials. The fans cheered when the lights finally came back on and the game continued.\n- In the middle of the 12th inning, the game was interrupted by a power outage that affected one of the light towers. The stadium became dark and the game was stopped until the issue was resolved. The fans entertained themselves by pointing their cell phones at the field and creating a makeshift light show. The players remained on the field, keeping warm and loose, while the umpires checked with the crew. After 16 minutes, the power was restored and the game went on.",
      "Outcome5": "The marathon game featured several twists and turns, as both teams squandered chances to end it earlier. The Red Sox left 18 runners on base, while the Yankees stranded 17. Each team used eight pitchers, and both bullpens were depleted by the end of the night. The game also saw some controversial calls, such as a reversed tag play that helped the Red Sox score in the 16th, and a fan interference that cost the Yankees a potential run in the seventh.",
      "Outcome6": "I cannot help with this task."

      "Outcome1": "Chelsea Football Club are on the verge of winning their fourth Premier League title, and their first under the return of manager Jose Mourinho. The Blues have been dominant throughout the season, losing only two games and scoring 65 goals so far. Their star players, such as Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and John Terry, have been in superb form, and have helped the team overcome their rivals, such as Manchester City and Arsenal. With only six games left, Chelsea need just three more wins to secure the trophy, and they could even clinch it sooner if their opponents drop points. The club are also in the semi-finals of the FA Cup, where they will face Bradford City at Wembley Stadium. If they win both competitions, it would be their first domestic double since 2010.",
      "Outcome2": "If Chelsea Football Club clinches the Premier League title this season, they have planned to celebrate with a parade around Stamford Bridge on May 25.",
      "Outcome3": "With six games to go, Chelsea are in a commanding position to win the Premier League title for the first time since 2010. However, they still face some tough opponents and have to maintain their focus and consistency until the end of the season. Here are their remaining fixtures and some of the challenges and opportunities they present.\n\n- Leicester (away) - April 29. Leicester are fighting for survival at the bottom of the table and have won four of their last five games. They will be determined to cause an upset and spoil Chelsea's party. However, Chelsea have a good record against them, having won the last four meetings, including a 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge in December.\n- Crystal Palace (home) - May 3. Crystal Palace are in mid-table and have little to play for, but they have shown some flair and resilience under Alan Pardew. They beat Manchester City 2-1 at home earlier this month and could pose a threat on the counter-attack. Chelsea will have to be wary of their pace and creativity, but should have enough quality and experience to overcome them.\n- Liverpool (home) - May 10. Liverpool are still in the race for a top four finish and will be keen to avenge their 2-1 defeat at Anfield in November, when Diego Costa scored the winner. Liverpool have improved since then, especially with the return of Daniel Sturridge and the emergence of Philippe Coutinho. Chelsea will have to deal with their pressing and movement, but will also look to exploit their defensive frailties.\n- West Brom (away) - May 18. West Brom are safe from relegation and have nothing to lose, but they are also unlikely to trouble Chelsea too much. They have scored the fewest goals in the league and have lost their last three games. Chelsea will expect to dominate possession and create chances, but will also have to be alert to the physicality and set-pieces of Tony Pulis' side.\n- Sunderland (home) - May 24. Sunderland are in the thick of the relegation battle and will be desperate for points in their final game of the season. They have a history of upsetting Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, having won there 2-1 last season and drawn 3-3 in 2014. Chelsea will have to cope with their intensity and determination, but will also hope to have wrapped up the title by then and celebrate in style.",
      "Outcome4": "The victory parade is a way of celebrating the achievements of Chelsea Football Club and sharing the joy with their loyal fans. It is an opportunity for the players, staff, and supporters to show their appreciation and gratitude to each other, and to enjoy the fruits of their hard work and dedication throughout the season. The victory parade is also a symbol of the pride and prestige that the club brings to the local community and the city of London. It is a chance for the fans to witness their heroes up close and personal, and to create unforgettable memories that will last a lifetime.",
      "Outcome5": "Chelsea have been the dominant force in the league this season, losing only two games and scoring 64 goals so far. Their recent 1-0 win over Manchester United at Stamford Bridge, courtesy of a brilliant goal by Eden Hazard, has put them within touching distance of their first title since 2010. With a game in hand over their rivals, they only need to win three more matches to secure the trophy. Their remaining fixtures are:",
      "Outcome6": "Chelsea are on the verge of securing their fourth Premier League title in 11 years, and have already begun preparations for a jubilant celebration with their fans. The Blues have been dominant this season, losing only two games and scoring 65 goals. With a comfortable lead over their rivals, they could even clinch the trophy before their final home game against Sunderland on May 24. To mark their achievement, Chelsea have planned a victory parade through the streets around Stamford Bridge on the following day, subject to official confirmation."

Mr. Christie, 52, has been widely seen as a potential contender for the Republican nomination, but has faced some challenges, such as the Bridgegate scandal and his low approval ratings in his home state. However, he has also shown some strengths, such as his outspokenness, his bipartisan appeal, and his experience in dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. While it is too early to predict how Mr. Christie would fare in the crowded and uncertain field of candidates, his wife's decision suggests that he is serious about pursuing his presidential ambitions.",
      "Outcome5": "The move comes amid speculation that the New Jersey governor is preparing to launch a bid for the Republican nomination, despite his low poll numbers and the lingering scandal over the George Washington Bridge lane closures. Mrs Christie, who has been married to the governor since 1986 and has four children with him, has reportedly been supportive of her husband's political ambitions and has accompanied him on several trips to key states.",

Mary Pat Christie, who has a background in bond trading and investment banking, has been a key adviser and fundraiser for her husband's political career, as well as a mother of four. She previously said she would quit her job if he decided to run for the White House, citing the demands of the campaign trail and the need to avoid potential conflicts of interest."

      "Left": "California Gov. Jerry Brown ordered state officials to impose mandatory water restrictions for the first time in history on Wednesday, as the state continues to grapple with a serious drought. Brown said Wednesday that he had signed an executive order requiring the State Water Resources Control Board to implement measures in cities and towns to cut water usage by 25 percent compared with 2013 levels. California has been in a drought for four years. 'We're in a historic drought and that demands unprecedented action,' Brown at a news conference held at Echo Summit in the Sierra Nevada.  'We have to pull together and save water in every way we can.' Scroll down for video . Changes: California Gov. Jerry Brown, speaking at the podium, ordered state officials to impose mandatory water restrictions for the first time in history on Wednesday . Test: Frank Gehrke, left, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program for the Department of Water Resources, points to a mark on the snow pack measuring pole that was the lowest previous snow pack level as  Gov. Brown, center, and Mark Cowin, director of the Department of Water Resources, right, look on . State water officials found no snow on the ground at the site for their manual survey of the snowpack. Brown's order will require campuses, golf courses, cemeteries and other large landscapes to significantly cut water use; direct local governments to replace 50 million square feet of lawns throughout the state with drought-tolerant landscaping; and create a temporary rebate program for consumers who replace old water-sucking appliances with more efficient ones. The move will affect residents, businesses, farmers and other users. CBS News quoted Brown as saying 'People should realize we're in a new era. The idea of your nice little green grass getting lots of water every day, that's going to be a thing of the past. 'We're not going to change everything overnight but we are in a transition period. People have to realize that in many parts of California, they are living in a desert.' The order calls on local water agencies to implement tiered water pricing that charges higher rates as more water is used and requires agricultural users to report more water use information to state regulators. Brown's office said that would boost the state's ability to enforce laws against illegal water diversions and water waste. The order also prohibits new homes and developments from using drinkable water for irrigation if the structures lack water-efficient drip systems",

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The executive order issued by Gov. Brown to impose mandatory water restrictions and a rebate program has elicited different responses and reactions from various stakeholders in California. Some of the main ones are:\n\n- Local governments: While some local governments have welcomed the order as a necessary step to cope with the drought, others have expressed concerns about the feasibility and fairness of the 25 percent reduction target, especially for those that have already made significant conservation efforts. Some local officials have also questioned the authority of the state to mandate water pricing and landscaping changes, and have asked for more flexibility and incentives to implement the order.\n- Businesses: Businesses that rely heavily on water, such as agriculture, landscaping, tourism, and manufacturing, have been hit hard by the drought and the restrictions. Some have argued that the order does not take into account the economic impact and the regional variations of water availability and use. Others have sought exemptions, waivers, or assistance from the state to comply with the order. Some businesses have also taken proactive measures to reduce their water use, such as installing water-efficient devices, recycling water, or switching to drought-tolerant crops or products.\n- Farmers: Farmers, who account for about 80 percent of the state's water use, have faced severe challenges due to the drought and the restrictions. Some have had to fallow land, lay off workers, sell livestock, or pump groundwater, which depletes aquifers and causes land subsidence. Some have criticized the order for not addressing the long-term issues of water rights, allocation, and infrastructure, and for not providing enough funding or support for water conservation and efficiency. Some have also advocated for more water storage and conveyance projects, such as dams and canals, to increase the state's water supply.\n- Environmentalists: Environmentalists have generally supported the order as a way to protect the state's ecosystems and wildlife, which have suffered from the drought and the overuse of water. Some have applauded the order for encouraging a shift away from water-intensive lawns and crops, and for promoting water reuse and recycling. Some have also urged the state to impose stricter regulations on groundwater pumping, which threatens the sustainability of the state's water resources. Some have also opposed some water storage and conveyance projects, such as dams and canals, which they claim would harm the environment and the endangered species.\n- Residents: Residents, who account for about 20 percent of the state's water use, have reacted differently to the order depending on their location, income, lifestyle, and awareness. Some have complied with the order voluntarily or out of necessity, and have adopted water-saving habits, such as taking shorter showers, fixing leaks, or replacing appliances. Some have also taken advantage of the rebate program to install low-flow toilets, showerheads, or faucets, or to replace their lawns with drought-tolerant plants. Others have resisted or resented the order, and have continued to use water wastefully or excessively, such as watering their lawns, filling their pools, or washing their cars. Some have also complained about the higher water bills, the reduced water quality, or the lack of enforcement of the order.",
      "Outcome2": "The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) has issued a framework for urban water suppliers to achieve the 25 percent reduction in potable water use mandated by the governor. The framework assigns each supplier a conservation standard based on its per-capita water use in 2013, ranging from 8 percent to 36 percent. Suppliers that already have low water use will have lower targets, while those with high water use will have higher ones. The SWRCB estimates that the framework will save about 1.3 million acre-feet of water over the next nine months, enough to supply more than 6 million people for a year. The SWRCB will monitor the suppliers' compliance and enforcement actions, and may impose fines or penalties for non-compliance.\n\nThe framework also includes provisions for addressing the needs of disadvantaged communities, ensuring public health and safety, and recognizing regional differences. For example, the framework allows for adjustments for suppliers that serve areas with a high proportion of outdoor irrigation, such as parks and recreational facilities. It also allows for exemptions for suppliers that rely on desalinated water, recycled water, or groundwater that is not connected to other basins. Furthermore, the framework encourages suppliers to implement drought surcharges, water budgets, or allocation-based rates to incentivize conservation among customers.\n\nThe SWRCB's framework applies only to urban water suppliers, which account for about 80 percent of the state's potable water use. The remaining 20 percent is used by agricultural, industrial, and other sectors, which are subject to different regulations and incentives. For instance, the governor's order requires agricultural water suppliers to report their water use, diversions, and transfers to the state, and to develop drought management plans. The order also provides funding and technical assistance for water efficiency projects, groundwater management, and emergency drinking water supplies. Additionally, the order streamlines the review and approval process for voluntary water transfers and exchanges, which can help move water to areas of greatest need.\n\nThe impact of the governor's order and the SWRCB's framework will vary across different sectors and regions, depending on their water sources, demands, and conservation efforts. Some areas, such as the Central Valley and the southern coast, will face greater challenges and costs than others, due to their dependence on imported water, high population density, and agricultural production. Other areas, such as the northern coast and the mountains, will have more local and reliable water supplies, lower water use, and less economic activity. However, all areas will have to adapt to the new reality of water scarcity and uncertainty, and collaborate with other stakeholders to achieve a sustainable balance between water supply and demand.",
      "Outcome3": "The governor's executive order marks a historic step in the state's response to the prolonged drought, which has depleted reservoirs, groundwater and snowpack. By requiring a 25 percent reduction in urban water use and promoting more efficient and drought-tolerant landscaping and appliances, the order aims to save about 1.5 million acre-feet of water over the next nine months. However, achieving this goal will not be easy, as it will require significant changes in behavior and practices among various sectors and stakeholders. The following sections will discuss the challenges and opportunities for water conservation in California, and the potential impacts of the drought on the environment, economy and society.",
      "Outcome4": "The historic drought in California has been caused by a combination of factors, including below-average precipitation, record-high temperatures, reduced snowpack, and increased water demand. Scientists have linked the drought to climate change, which has altered the patterns of atmospheric circulation and moisture transport over the Pacific Ocean and Western North America. The result is a persistent high-pressure ridge that blocks storms from reaching California, and a low-pressure trough that brings warm and dry air to the region.\n\nThe impacts of the drought are severe and widespread, affecting the environment and society in various ways. The lack of water has reduced the availability and quality of drinking water, endangered wildlife and ecosystems, increased the risk of wildfires and landslides, threatened agriculture and food production, and worsened air pollution and public health. The drought has also triggered conflicts and disputes over water rights and allocations, and imposed economic and social costs on individuals and communities. According to a recent study by UC Davis, the drought could cost the state about $3 billion in 2015, with most of the losses in the agricultural sector. The drought has also exacerbated the inequalities and vulnerabilities of different groups, such as low-income families, rural residents, Native Americans, and migrant workers, who face greater challenges and hardships in accessing and affording water.",
      "Outcome5": "In addition, the order gives state regulators more authority to crack down on illegal water use and waste, as well as to fine those who violate the restrictions. The State Water Resources Control Board will also develop new standards for indoor and outdoor water use in urban areas. Brown said the state's previous voluntary conservation efforts have not been enough, as the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada, which normally provides about a third of the state's water supply, has dwindled to its lowest level on record. 'This is really an effort to deal with the realities of nature,' he said. 'It's not a partisan issue, it's not a factional issue, it's a common sense issue.'",
      "Outcome6": "The governor's announcement came as the state marked a grim milestone in its historic drought. Earlier on Wednesday, state water officials conducted their final snow survey of the winter and found no snow on the ground at the site in the Sierra Nevada. The snowpack, which normally provides about a third of the state's water supply, is at its lowest level on record. 'It is such an unprecedented lack of snow, it is way, way below records,' Brown said. 'We're in uncharted territory.'"

MOM: Nacer Chadli . Eriksen's free-kick goes direction in from out wide for the winner - CLICK HERE to see more from Sportsmail's MATCH ZONE . ‘I’m angry. It’s another defeat and that’s not good enough. This is the most difficult situation I’ve ever been in but I’m not going to give up on it.’ Although the official attendance was returned as a massively inaccurate 47, 427 – making it the biggest of the weekend in the top-flight – estimates had it nearer 40,000 as fans stayed away in protest at Mike Ashley’s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of £18.7million before revealing they have a further £34m in the bank. The billionaire will need to part with a sizeable chunk of that cash this summer if Newcastle are to avoid a season-long struggle against relegation next time around. One banner – unfurled during a pre-match protest outside of the Gallowgate End – captured the mood of frustration and mistrust among supporters – ‘NUFC – Balance sheet champions, 2008-2014’. Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher, meanwhile, launched a scathing attack on Ashley. ‘People will say as supporters you’ve got to come back, you’ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters?’ he said. ‘Since Mike Ashley’s been here they’ve been relegated once and they could be relegated again. ‘So he’s balanced the books and he’s made money because he’s a businessman, but I think of these people and wonder, “Don’t you want to be excited yourself?”. ‘I’m getting bored by Newcastle. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there’s nothing happening? There’s no cup run, I just don’t get it. I don’t get why he wants to own a football club.’ The defeat leaves Newcastle seven points above the drop zone and Carver has previously confessed that he does not know where their next point is coming from. Tottenham striker Harry Kane at full stretch with of Spurs is chased down by Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini . After Kane was chosen as caretaker of the captain's armband, Jan Vertonghen returned to lead Tottenham at St James' Park . Kane is assessed early in the match after inadvertently being caught in the head by the arm of Newcastle's Vernon Anita . On this evidence, they may well have to rely on their current tally of 35 being enough. They were hardly helped here by Tim Krul. But perhaps the loss of form of the usually-dependable goalkeeper best represents the problems which have plagued the squad in recent weeks. The Dutch stopper could have done more to keep out Chadli’s first-half opener and was again culpable as Eriksen struck to restore the lead after Jack Colback had levelled early in the second half. Chadli appeared to have exhausted his options as he floated in possession 25 yards from goal only to drop his shoulder before slamming into the bottom corner with Krul sluggish in his pursuit of the strike. Carver reacted to an insipid first half by hooking the ineffective Yoan Gouffran and midfielder Mehdi Abeid and within 20 seconds they were level when Colback steamed onto a loose ball inside the area before slotting home. Chadli was given space outside the box and pulled the trigger just as Newcastle midfielder Jack Colback arrived in defence . Colback is too late as the Belgian laces his shot from range and it nestles in the bottom corner giving Newcastle keeper Tim Krul no chance . Chadli celebrates after scoring the goal to send Spurs on their way on a tough day for Newcastle amid fan protests . Chadli leaps in the air with delight after his sublime strike for the opening goal of the match . Christian Eriksen (left) tussles with Newcastle's Ryan Taylor at St James' Park on Sunday . But parity was to last just eight minutes and Eriksen’s free-kick – intended as a cross – bounced through the weak grasp of Krul and into the back of the net. Krul, in fairness, made a string of fine stops to keep Newcastle within one but he was powerless to prevent Kane rolling beyond him in stoppage-time after he had skipped onto Erik Lamela’s through-ball. In doing so Kane became the first Spurs player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to score 30 goals in one season. And the England striker now has Lineker’s total of 35 in his sights. Jack Colback is in the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball in the midfield and equalise for Newcastle . Colback jumps for joy after his fourth goal of the season, all of which have been scored at Newcastle's home St James' Park . Fans applaud while one holds up a 'Love NUFC, No Ashley' sign, while Colback's Newcastle team-mates join in the celebrations . ‘I'm very proud but there are five games left and, hopefully, I'll get a few more goals,’ he said. Manager Mauricio Pochettino added: ‘We were better than Newcastle and deserved the win. ‘For Harry, it is a fantastic achievement. We need to push him now because he has a lot of improvement left in him.’ Newcastle, meanwhile, will also need to improve in the final five matches of their sorry season, or risk starting next in the second tier.

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Newcastle United's miserable season continued on Sunday as they slumped to a 3-1 defeat at home to Tottenham Hotspur, amid a mass boycott by the fans who are unhappy with the club's owner Mike Ashley. The Magpies have now lost six consecutive games in the Premier League, equalling their worst ever run, and are still not safe from relegation. Tottenham, meanwhile, boosted their hopes of qualifying for the Europa League, thanks to goals from Nacer Chadli, Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane, who reached the 30-goal mark for the season.",
      "Outcome2": "The victory lifted Tottenham to sixth place, just seven points behind Manchester City in the final Champions League spot with a game in hand. Spurs have won three of their last four games and will hope to maintain their momentum as they face Southampton, Manchester City, and Stoke in their next three fixtures. Kane's milestone also boosted his chances of winning the Golden Boot, as he matched Aguero's 20 goals in the league.\n\nNewcastle, on the other hand, remained in 14th place, but only seven points above the relegation zone with five games left. The Magpies have lost six consecutive games for the first time in the Premier League era, and have scored just five goals in that run. Their next opponents are Swansea, Leicester, West Brom, QPR, and West Ham, all of whom are either fighting for survival or aiming for a top-half finish. Carver will need to inspire his players to avoid a disastrous end to a turbulent season.",
      "Outcome3": "- John Carver on his team's performance: \"I'm very disappointed with the way we conceded the goals. We gave the ball away cheaply and didn't defend the set-pieces well enough. We showed some spirit in the second half, but it was too little too late.\"\n- Nacer Chadli on his goal and Spurs' form: \"It was a good strike, I saw the space and went for it. I'm happy to help the team and score goals. We have a lot of quality in the squad and we want to finish the season strongly and fight for the top four.\"\n- Jack Colback on the fans' protest and Newcastle's situation: \"We understand the fans' frustration, they have every right to express their feelings. We appreciate their support and we need them behind us in these difficult times. We have to stick together as a team and a club and try to get out of this rut.\"\n- Harry Kane on his 30th goal and his targets: \"It's a great feeling to reach 30 goals, it's something I dreamed of at the start of the season. I want to thank my team-mates and the staff for helping me achieve this. But I'm not satisfied yet, I want to keep scoring and help the team win as many games as possible.\"",
      "Outcome4": "The final whistle was greeted with a chorus of boos from the home fans, who have grown weary of watching their team slide down the table. Carver faces a daunting task to lift his players and convince Ashley to invest in new signings this summer. Newcastle travel to Swansea next week, hoping to end their losing streak and secure their Premier League status. Spurs, on the other hand, moved above Southampton into sixth place and will look to keep up their challenge for a Europa League spot when they host Manchester City. Pochettino's men have shown resilience and flair in recent weeks, and Kane has been the talisman of their season.",

They have brought with them patriotic attire, festive decorations, and gifts for the new arrival. Among them is Margaret Tyler, 71, who has attended every major royal event in the past decade.\n- The anticipation for the royal birth is building up, and some fans are not taking any chances of missing the big moment.

An Asda manager orchestrated a scam that used the supermarket's own delivery service to steal goods worth more than £15,000 - then managed to land a job at Lidl after he was sacked. Michael Gridley, 26, was jailed after running the scam where stock including alcohol, cigarettes, DVDs, computer games and consoles were taken from the store in Basildon, Essex, where he worked. Southend Crown Court heard how the conspiracy was uncovered, following a period during which Gridley and colleague Jay Reed were under suspicion. Thomas Daniel, prosecuting, told the court that goods, ranging from televisions to baby formula, were delivered to Reed's address and presumably sold on. He said: 'Two anonymous reports were received by Asda, one of which suggested Mr Gridley was involved in selling items believed to have been stolen, such as TVs and baby formula. 'When Mr Gridley was ill for a certain period of time, those deliveries stopped, and when he recovered they started again. 'Another email suggested stolen goods being delivered to the address of Mr Gridley's cousin.' But shockingly, after being sacked from the store, Gridley managed to land a managerial role at Lidl in Romford, Essex. Gridley, who was former home shopping manager of the store, was sentenced to 12 months for his leading role in a conspiracy to steal £15,852.46 worth of goods between November 2013 and April last year. The court heard that Reed and another defendant James Munyard had been pressured into taking part in the scam by Gridley, who was their superior. Stock including alcohol, cigarettes were taken from shelves and delivered to addresses using the supermarket's own home delivery service. File photo . Section leader Reed, 23, and Munyard, 21, both avoided prison, but were given suspended sentences of eight and four months, respectively. Mitchell Cohen, representing Munyard, told the court that his client, whose role was confined to taking items off shelves and putting them in a crate, had attempted to be transferred from the store in order to escape Gridley's control"

Jay Reed, 23, was a section leader who worked under Gridley and helped him process the orders for the stolen goods. He also received some of the deliveries at his address and resold the items. James Munyard, 21, was a picker who took the goods from the shelves and put them in a crate to be loaded onto the vans. Both Reed and Munyard claimed that they had been pressured by Gridley to participate in the theft and feared losing their jobs if they refused. The court heard that Reed had a previous conviction for theft and Munyard had none. Reed was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work. Munyard was given a four-month sentence, suspended for 12 months, and told to do 100 hours of unpaid work. Both men were also ordered to pay £1,000 in compensation to Asda.",
      "Outcome2": "- Michael Gridley, a former home shopping manager at Asda in Basildon, Essex, orchestrated a scam to steal over £15,000 of goods from the store using its own delivery service.\n- He enlisted two colleagues, Jay Reed and James Munyard, to take items off shelves and deliver them to addresses where they were presumably sold on.\n- The scam was exposed by anonymous reports that linked Gridley to stolen goods and noticed a pattern of deliveries that matched his absence and presence at work.\n- Gridley was jailed for 12 months, while Reed and Munyard received suspended sentences. Gridley had managed to get a job at Lidl after being sacked by Asda.",
      "Outcome3": "The scam was eventually discovered by an internal investigation, which revealed that Gridley had used the store's computer system to create fake orders and invoices for the stolen goods. He then assigned Reed and Munyard to pick up the items from the shelves and load them into the delivery vans, while he checked and signed off the orders himself. The goods were then delivered to various addresses, including Gridley's cousin and Reed's home, where they were presumably sold on for profit. Gridley, who admitted conspiracy to steal, showed no remorse for his actions, and even secured another job at Lidl after being sacked by Asda. His accomplices, who pleaded guilty to the same charge, expressed regret and said they were pressured by Gridley, who was their boss. The court heard that Gridley had a previous conviction for theft from an employer in 2010, and that he had used the money from the scam to fund his gambling addiction. Judge Samantha Cohen said Gridley was the \"prime mover\" of the scheme, and that he had abused his position of trust and responsibility. She said the scam had caused significant loss and damage to Asda, and also affected the customers who were deprived of the products they wanted to buy. She said: \"This was a sophisticated and well-planned operation, involving a large amount of stock over a long period of time. You exploited the system that was designed to benefit the customers and the company, and you did so for your own personal gain.\"",
      "Outcome4": "A court has heard how a rogue Asda boss used the supermarket's delivery vans to loot thousands of pounds worth of goods from his own store. The scam was revealed by anonymous tip-offs and an internal investigation, but the ringleader managed to get another job at Lidl after being fired. The Mail Online reports on the details of the case and the sentences handed to the three culprits.",
      "Outcome5": "Gridley used his position as home shopping manager to manipulate Reed and Munyard into helping him carry out the thefts. He would instruct them to pick up items that were not part of any genuine order, and put them in a crate labelled for delivery. He would then assign himself to be the driver of the van that delivered the goods to addresses of his relatives or friends. He would falsify the records to make it seem like the deliveries were legitimate. The scam went on for several months, with Gridley pocketing the proceeds from selling the stolen goods.",
      "Outcome6": "Reed, of Basildon, admitted stealing £10,532.93 worth of goods while Munyard, of Canvey Island, pleaded guilty to stealing £1,055. The court heard that neither man made any financial gain from the scam and were coerced by Gridley, who threatened them with dismissal or demotion. Cohen said: 'Mr Munyard was in fear of his job and felt he had no choice but to comply with what Mr Gridley was asking him to do.' David Bird, representing Reed, said: 'He was a section leader, one rung above Mr Munyard, but still very much under the thumb of Mr Gridley. He was manipulated and bullied by him.' In April last year, Asda security staff searched Gridley's car and found alcohol, cigarettes and DVDs that had not been paid for. They also found delivery notes with Reed's address on them."

      "Left": "Former world champion Ken Doherty launched a spirited fightback to lead snooker's top woman player Reanne Evans 5-4 at the interval of their World Championship first qualifying round match in Sheffield. Doherty, who won the title in 1997, won four of the final five frames of the morning session after trailing 3-1 at one stage against 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley who is bidding to become the first woman to appear in the main stages of the world finals at The Crucible. The match will be played to a conclusion when it resumes on Thursday evening. In total, 128 players are involved in qualifying, including legendary names Steve Davis and Jimmy White. Reanne Evans trails Ken Doherty 5-4 at the interval of her World Championship qualifier . Evans is taking on Doherty in a World Championship qualifier and he took the opening frame 71-15 . But Evans settled and hit back brilliantly, taking the next three frames to build an imposing lead . Players have to win three best-of-19 frame rounds to go forward to the World Championship which begins later this month. Of the 10 matches taking place simultaneously on Thursday morning at the Ponds Forge international sports centre in Sheffield, all eyes were on Evans, a big outsider against Doherty despite being a 10-time world champion herself. Television crews from all the major broadcasters and the biggest name in snooker Ronnie O'Sullivan were among those to see the action unfold. The first frame went according to the form book with Doherty winning 71-15 as Evans made a nervy start. But she quickly got over them to win the tactical battle in the next two frames and then rattled up the first break above 50 in the match, a 51 to win the fourth frame after Doherty fluffed a black. Doherty, 45, had admitted before the match he felt extra pressure facing a woman. Evans came up against a resurgent Doherty after the mid-session interval and he now holds the lead . Doherty leads the 29-year-old Evans for the first time since taking the opening frame ",

She looked set to extend her lead when she had the first scoring chance in the fifth frame, but a missed red let Doherty back in. The Irishman seized the opportunity and made a break of 75 to reduce the deficit. It was the start of a remarkable turnaround, as Doherty found his rhythm and punished Evans' errors. He won the next three frames with breaks of 54, 89 and 64, taking control of the match. Evans managed to stop the rot in the ninth frame, but still trailed 5-4 at the interval.",
      "Outcome2": "The Ponds Forge venue was buzzing with excitement and curiosity as the match between Ken Doherty and Reanne Evans resumed after the interval. The crowd was divided between cheering for the former world champion, who had shown his class and experience to turn a 3-1 deficit into a 5-4 lead, and rooting for the underdog, who had impressed everyone with her skill and composure in the first session. It was a historic occasion, as Evans was aiming to become the first woman to qualify for the World Championship at the Crucible, snooker's most prestigious stage. Many fans and media members were eager to see if she could pull off a shock upset, or if Doherty would prove too strong and experienced. The match was finely poised, with both players needing five more frames to secure their place in the next round. It was a tense and thrilling spectacle, with every shot and mistake potentially decisive.",
      "Outcome3": "Evans and Doherty are both trailblazers in their own right, having achieved remarkable feats in the sport of snooker. Evans is widely regarded as the best female player ever, having dominated the women's game for more than a decade. She has won 12 world titles, including a record 10 consecutive ones from 2005 to 2014. She has also competed against male players in various events, becoming the first woman to reach the final of the Snooker Shoot-Out in 2020.\n\nDoherty is one of the most successful players from Ireland, having won six ranking titles, including the World Championship in 1997. He is also the only player to have been world champion at junior, amateur and professional levels. He has reached three more World Championship finals, in 1998, 2003 and 2006, losing to John Higgins, Mark Williams and Graeme Dott respectively. He is still competing on the main tour at the age of 45, and is ranked 68th in the world.",
      "Outcome4": "Evans, the top woman player in snooker, made a strong comeback after losing the first frame to former world champion Doherty. She showed her skill and composure in the next three frames, winning them with clever tactics and a break of 51. Doherty, who felt extra pressure facing a woman, struggled to find his rhythm and missed some easy shots. Evans took a 3-1 lead at the mid-session interval.",
      "Outcome5": "Evans was not deterred by the former world champion's fightback and continued to pose problems with her safety play and potting. She levelled the match at 4-4 with a 58 break, the highest of the match so far. But Doherty showed his experience and composure in the ninth frame, making a break of 62 to edge ahead 5-4 before the session ended.",
      "Outcome6": "In frame five, Doherty rediscovered his form and produced a superb clearance of 131 to reduce his deficit. He then levelled the match with a break of 65 in the sixth after Evans missed an easy pink. The Irishman edged ahead 4-3 with another half-century break, but Evans responded with a gutsy 47 to force a decider. However, Doherty showed his class and experience in the final frame of the session, making a break of 76 to clinch it 74-20 and take a slender lead into the evening."

An American transgender woman is preparing to move to the UK to marry a bride she has never met in order to fulfil a 'lifelong dream' of becoming a British citizen. Hayley Carney will undergo surgery to complete her gender transition before moving to live with her fiancee, identified only as Anne, in Plymouth, Devon, later this year. She will then have six months to apply for a marriage visa, which, if successful, will set her on the path to citizenship. Ms Carney, formerly known as Robert, said she has been dreaming of a life in Britain since reading books about it as a child. She added that she feels the nation is more accepting of 'people like her'. But it was only after meeting Anne in an online support group that she decided to make a move to the country she 'has always wanted to call home'. She said: '[Anne] told me months ago that my life would be more comfortable in England, not only because my heart has always been there, but overall Britain is more openly accepting of people like me. 'I cannot wait to be there with her and in a country I have always wanted to call home. 'In my heart, that's always been my home since I could read. I have dreamed of being a British citizen my whole life. 'I have found throughout life that British people are kind and polite. I have several friends I have made over the years and they really are some of the best friends anyone could ask for",
      "Right": ". 'I have spoken with many people about my upcoming move and they all say that my life would be less complicated and acceptance is found more easily there. 'I cannot speak for more people than I know, but in comparing friends from here in the US to my friends in the UK, my British friends are the most wonderful, caring, loving and accepting people I know.' Moving to Britain: Ms Carney, pictured, will undergo surgery to complete her gender transition before moving to live with her fiancee, identified only as Anne, in Plymouth, Devon, later this year . Ms Carney intends to move to the UK and search for a job before applying for a visa. She said: 'Immigration is a huge concern of mine. What I need to do is get there, settle in, find employment, then follow all proper channels to eventually earn myself a British citizenship. 'Once acclimatised, I will proudly hold my head high and call myself British, but not until I have earned that right. 'When I come home to England, I want it to be for the remainder of my life. 'There are so many reasons people migrate; personally I just want a better life. I am prepared for what may come my way on the road to becoming a permanent British citizen.'"

      "Outcome1": "Despite her excitement, Ms Carney is also aware of the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead of her as she plans to relocate to a country where she has never set foot. She said she has done extensive research on the immigration process and the legal requirements to marry Anne and secure a visa. She hopes that her love for Britain and her commitment to contribute to society will help her overcome any obstacles. She said:",
      "Outcome2": "She continued: 'I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and I have worked as a web developer and a software engineer for several years. I enjoy creating applications and websites that are user-friendly and accessible. I also have some experience in graphic design and video editing. I am fluent in English and Spanish, and I have some basic knowledge of French and German. I am eager to learn new skills and adapt to different work environments. I hope to find a job that allows me to use my creativity and technical abilities, and that also supports the LGBT+ community. I have applied for some positions online, but I know it will be easier to look for jobs once I am in the UK. I am confident that I can contribute positively to the British economy and society.'",
      "Outcome3": "I met Anne online through a support group for transgender women. We started chatting and found out we had a lot in common, such as our love for books, music, and animals. She was very supportive of my transition and encouraged me to be myself. She also shared with me her own experiences of living as a trans woman in the UK, and how she managed to overcome the challenges and find happiness. I was drawn to her kindness, intelligence, and sense of humour. She made me laugh and smile every day. We soon developed feelings for each other and decided to become a couple. We have been talking on the phone and video call every day, and we can't wait to meet in person and start our life together.",
      "Outcome4": "I am scheduled to have my surgery in August, and I am both nervous and excited. This is something I have wanted for a long time, and I feel it will make me more comfortable in my own body and more confident in myself. Anne has been very supportive and understanding, and she says she loves me no matter what. We have talked a lot about the surgery and what it will mean for our relationship, and we are both ready to face any challenges or changes that might come. We have also discussed the risks and complications that are possible, and we have agreed on how to deal with them if they happen. We trust each other and we communicate well, so I think we can handle anything together. The surgery will not change who I am as a person, but it will help me express who I am more fully and authentically. I hope that by becoming more aligned with my true self, I will also be able to integrate better into the society and culture of the country I love. I know that there might be some people who will not accept me or understand me, but I also know that there are many more who will welcome me and respect me. I look forward to starting a new life with Anne in Britain, and I hope to contribute positively to the community and the nation.",
      "Outcome5": "- Ms Carney, who currently lives in Texas, said she fell in love with Anne after exchanging messages and video calls for several months. She said they share a strong bond and a common passion for history, literature and art. 'We have so much in common, it's like we were meant to be together,' she said. 'She supports me in everything I do and loves me for who I am.'\n- Despite never having met in person, Ms Carney and Anne have already decided to tie the knot as soon as possible. They are planning a small wedding ceremony in Plymouth, where Anne works as a nurse. Ms Carney said she is eager to start a new life with her soulmate and experience the culture and beauty of Britain. 'I am so excited to see the places I have read about and visit the museums and galleries,' she said. 'I also want to learn more about the history and traditions of the country.'\n- The couple have faced some challenges and criticism from their families and friends, who do not understand their relationship or their decision to get married. Ms Carney said she has been estranged from her parents since coming out as transgender, and Anne has also faced some resistance from her relatives. However, they are determined to overcome the obstacles and follow their hearts. 'We know it's not going to be easy, but we love each other and we want to be happy,' she said. 'We don't care what anyone else thinks.'",
      "Outcome6": "Ms Carney said she had been struggling with her gender identity since she was a child, and had faced discrimination and abuse in her home country. She began her transition process in 2016, taking hormones and undergoing electrolysis. She also changed her name and documents to reflect her female identity. She said: 'Transitioning is not easy, especially here in the States. I have faced ridicule, judgement, and even threats of violence. But I have also received support and love from some amazing people who see me for who I really am.' She met Anne online last year, and they quickly developed a close bond based on their shared experiences and interests. They began a long-distance relationship, talking every day and sending each other gifts and letters. They plan to meet for the first time in person when Ms Carney arrives in the UK. She said: 'Anne is the most wonderful woman I have ever known. She is smart, funny, beautiful, and compassionate. She understands me like no one else does. She is my soulmate and I love her with all my heart.'"

      "Left": "Keith Cameron, pictured,  was jailed for five years for scamming his dying friend and neighbour out of his life savings . A conman has been jailed for fleecing a dying architect out of his life savings and using the money to fund his lavish lifestyle. Keith Cameron splashed out on a New York flat for his daughter and enjoyed a string of extravagant holidays while his victim's family have been left facing the prospect of selling their home. The 54-year-old scammed his trusting friend and terminally ill neighbour, Jonathan Speirs, out of £476,864 in a complicated ruse. He promised the world-famous lighting architect a £2million return on his investment in just two years, but it was all an elaborate lie. Cameron was today jailed for five years at Edinburgh Sheriff Court. But Jonathan's wife, Elizabeth, 58, said: 'My daughters and I will be dealing with the consequences of his crime both emotionally and financially for the rest of our lives.' Cameron stole the family's money and spent it on his extravagant lifestyle and a New York flat for his own daughter, who attended the American Academy of Drama and the Arts. Meanwhile, Jonathan's youngest daughter faces missing out on a place at her dream university in New York. Cameron persuaded terminally ill Jonathan - his close friend and neighbour for 13 years - to part with thousands of pounds by claiming his telecoms start-up required money to win a valuable contract. He repeatedly claimed the company was trading well and that Jonathan could expect a return on his investment of around £2 million within two years. Cameron, from Edinburgh, instead used his friend's cash to maintain a excessive lifestyle of posh restaurants and fancy holidays. Jonathan died of stomach cancer in 2012. His widow, Elizabeth, from Edinburgh, said Cameron's heartless scheme had stopped her daughter, Erin, 17, from following her dreams. She said: 'Keith Cameron deserved a lengthy prison sentence. I am glad the Sheriff chose to impose the maximum sentence on the fraud charge. 'However, no length of prison term will ever compensate for the dreadful crime he committed. 'My daughters and I will be dealing with the consequences of his crime both emotionally and financially for the rest of our lives. 'If Keith Cameron hadn't defrauded us, Erin could have followed her dreams. But we have to live with knowing that our money was spent on allowing Cameron's daughter to study in New York while my daughter can't. 'Despite having the academic qualifications and the ability to gain a place on this course, we'll probably have to turn it down because we can't afford the fees. Victims: Jonathan Speirs, a world-famous lighting architect, pictured with his wife Elizabeth, was persuaded to part with a total of £476,864 . 'This is so unfair and it's breaking my heart that I can't give her the education she has worked so hard for. 'I am struggling to come to terms with the depths of Keith Cameron's depravity now that I know the full details of how he deceived a dying man.' Elizabeth, a supply teacher, also revealed that Cameron had texted her asking to see her husband just days before he passed away in June 2012. Mr Speirs died of stomach cancer in 2012 after investing in his friends scam . The text read: 'Tell him I don't care what he looks like, he's a dear friend and that's all that matters.' Elizabeth said the family now faced being forced to sell off her home in Edinburgh where she had lived with her husband for 24 years",
      "Right": ". She said: 'It's still hard to believe that someone who, supposedly, was our friend could behave in such a cold-hearted fashion pretending to care about my husband and pretending to show grief at his funeral, whilst all the time he was knowingly spending our money on luxuries for his family - money we'd worked hard for. 'It fills me with horror to think that anyone could be so cruel and heartless towards a good, kind man but especially towards a man who was facing death. 'A lengthy prison sentence is totally justified.' Police Scotland Detective Inspector Arron Clinkscales added: 'Keith Cameron used his expertise and relationship to make his victim believe that this was a legitimate investment. 'To ensure that others do not fall foul of similar fraudulent activities I would urge the public to fully research any investment they are seeking to make. 'When considering making an investment, consider seeking financial and legal advice to ensure protection against fraudulent investments. 'If in any doubt, do not go ahead, and remember if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.' Mrs Speirs said she now faces selling off the home in Edinburgh she shared with her husband for 24 years. Pictured: Jonathan Speirs with Erin, Elizabeth and Lucie ."

      "Outcome1": "While Cameron used Speirs' money to indulge in luxury, Speirs' family suffered the loss of their life savings and their beloved husband and father. Cameron bought a New York flat for his daughter, who studied at a prestigious academy, and enjoyed extravagant holidays in exotic locations. He also frequented expensive restaurants and clubs, showing no remorse or guilt for his betrayal. Speirs' family, on the other hand, had to cope with the devastating impact of cancer and fraud on their lives. They struggled to pay for medical bills, funeral costs, and everyday expenses. They also faced the prospect of selling their home, where they had shared many happy memories, to make ends meet. Speirs' youngest daughter, Erin, had to give up her dream of studying in New York, while Cameron's daughter enjoyed the privilege of living and learning there. The contrast between Cameron's lavish lifestyle and Speirs' family's financial hardship was stark and cruel, and revealed the extent of Cameron's greed and heartlessness.",
      "Outcome2": "The court heard that Cameron, who had worked in the telecoms industry for 30 years, fabricated a story about launching a new company called Mytel, which he claimed was bidding for a lucrative contract to provide wireless services to remote parts of the UK. He convinced Speirs, who was an award-winning architect and designed the lighting for the Millennium Bridge in London and the Burj Al Arab hotel in Dubai, that his company was a great investment opportunity and offered him a stake in the business. He showed him forged documents, such as bank statements, invoices, and letters from public bodies, to back up his claims and persuade him to hand over large sums of money. He also lied about having other investors on board, such as a wealthy businessman from Qatar and a Scottish landowner. He assured Speirs that his investment was safe and that he could expect a return of around £2 million within two years. He also played on their friendship and exploited Speirs' vulnerability as he was suffering from terminal cancer. He pretended to care about his health and well-being, and even attended his funeral, while secretly spending his money on his own lavish lifestyle.",
      "Outcome3": "|begin paragraph|\nWhen Keith Cameron offered his dying friend and neighbour, Jonathan Speirs, a lucrative investment opportunity, he seemed like a trusted and caring companion. But behind his friendly facade, Cameron was a ruthless conman who stole almost half a million pounds from the terminally ill architect and used it to fund his own lavish lifestyle. His shocking betrayal has left Mr Speirs' widow and daughters devastated and struggling to cope with the financial and emotional aftermath of his crime.\n|end paragraph|",
      "Outcome4": "- Jonathan Speirs was a renowned lighting architect who designed iconic projects such as the Millennium Dome, the Burj al Arab hotel, and the Beijing Olympic Stadium. He was the founder and director of Speirs and Major Associates, a leading international lighting design consultancy that won numerous awards for its innovative and creative work. He was widely respected and admired in his field, and had a passion for teaching and mentoring young designers.\n- A pioneer and visionary in the field of lighting design, Jonathan Speirs transformed the way buildings and spaces were illuminated and experienced. He worked on some of the most prestigious and challenging projects in the world, including the Millennium Bridge, the Scottish Parliament, and the Copenhagen Opera House. He also collaborated with famous architects such as Norman Foster, Zaha Hadid, and Renzo Piano. His work was celebrated for its artistic flair, technical excellence, and environmental sensitivity.\n- With a career spanning more than 30 years, Jonathan Speirs was one of the most influential and acclaimed lighting architects of his generation. He had a remarkable ability to create dramatic and inspiring lighting schemes for a variety of contexts, from urban landmarks to historic monuments to cultural venues. He was involved in landmark projects such as the Grand Mosque of Abu Dhabi, the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore, and the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. He was also a generous and inspiring mentor, who shared his knowledge and enthusiasm with many young designers.",
      "Outcome5": "The court heard that Cameron had pretended to be a successful businessman and used his friendship with Jonathan to persuade him to invest in his company, Gildbarn Telecoms Ltd. He claimed he needed the money to buy shares in an American firm, which would secure a lucrative contract to install wi-fi systems in hotels across the US. He even showed Jonathan false bank statements and emails to back up his lies. But instead of investing the money, Cameron spent it on himself and his family, while telling Jonathan that his cash was safe and growing.",
      "Outcome6": "Cameron showed no remorse for his actions and continued to lie even after Jonathan's death. He told Elizabeth that he had repaid the money into her husband's bank account, but in fact he had transferred a small fraction of the sum from one of his own accounts. He also sent fake email confirmations and forged bank statements to cover up his tracks. Elizabeth only discovered the truth when she contacted the bank and was told that there was no record of any repayment. She then reported Cameron to the police, who launched an investigation and uncovered his elaborate fraud. Elizabeth said she was shocked and disgusted by Cameron's betrayal of her husband's trust."

      "Outcome2": "Honour killings are a brutal practice that involves murdering a family member, usually a woman or a girl, for allegedly bringing shame or dishonour to the family or community. Such killings are often motivated by caste, religion, or gender norms, and are sometimes carried out by relatives or mobs with the tacit or explicit approval of local authorities. According to human rights groups, hundreds of honour killings occur every year in India, especially in the northern states like Haryana, where patriarchy and feudalism are deeply entrenched. Despite the existence of laws that prohibit honour crimes and discrimination, many perpetrators escape justice or receive lenient sentences due to social pressure, corruption, or lack of evidence.",
      "Outcome3": "The horrific case of the young couple found murdered in boxes is a grim reminder of the prevalence and brutality of honour killings in India. Honour killings are acts of violence, usually carried out by family members, against those who are perceived to have brought shame or dishonour to their family or community by violating social norms, such as marrying outside their caste, religion, or ethnicity. According to a 2016 report by IndiaSpend, an estimated 1,111 honour killings took place between 2014 and 2015, although the actual number could be much higher due to under-reporting and lack of official data.\n\nHonour killings have devastating impacts and implications on the victims, their families, and the society at large. The victims are deprived of their right to life, dignity, and freedom of choice. They often suffer physical and psychological abuse, harassment, and threats before being killed. Their families are left traumatized, stigmatized, and ostracized by their own community. The society as a whole suffers from the loss of human potential, the erosion of social cohesion, and the perpetuation of gender inequality and discrimination.\n\nTo prevent honour killings, there is a need for a multi-pronged approach that involves legal, educational, social, and cultural interventions. On the legal front, there should be a specific law that defines and criminalizes honour killings and provides adequate protection and compensation for the victims and witnesses. The police and judiciary should be sensitized and trained to deal with such cases effectively and impartially. On the educational front, there should be awareness campaigns and curriculum reforms that promote human rights, gender equality, and intercultural dialogue. On the social front, there should be support networks and counselling services for the victims and their families, as well as incentives and opportunities for them to integrate into the mainstream society. On the cultural front, there should be a dialogue and engagement with the community leaders, religious figures, and media to challenge and change the patriarchal and conservative mindsets that justify honour killings.",
      "Outcome4": "I cannot help with this task.",
      "Outcome5": "Police suspect that the couple, who belonged to different castes, were murdered by their own families for eloping against their wishes. According to local media reports, the couple had fled their village about a month ago and got married in a secret ceremony. However, their relatives reportedly tracked them down and kidnapped them from their rented accommodation on Sunday night. They then allegedly tortured and killed them before dumping their bodies in the park.",
      "Outcome6": "Police suspect that the couple, who belonged to different castes, were killed by their families for eloping against their wishes. Honour killings are still prevalent in some parts of India, especially in rural areas, where inter-caste and inter-faith marriages are often met with violence and ostracism. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, more than 300 people were killed in honour killings in India in 2019, mostly by relatives who saw their relationships as a threat to their social status and reputation."

      "Outcome1": "The long sequence of defeats at Stamford Bridge is not only a source of frustration for Stoke, but also a sign of Chelsea's dominance in the Premier League era. The Blues have won 13 titles since 1992, and have been particularly formidable at home under Jose Mourinho, who has only lost one league game there in two spells as manager. Hughes knows his former club are a formidable obstacle, but he believes his players have shown enough quality and character this season to challenge any opponent. He said: 'They are top of the pile for a reason - they have been the most consistent team and have some outstanding individual talents. But we have a good group here, we are confident in what we are doing and we will go there with the intention of winning.'",
      "Outcome2": "|Hughes, who scored 39 goals in 123 appearances for Chelsea between 1995 and 1998, admitted that he has fond memories of his time at Stamford Bridge, but insisted that he will not let any sentiment get in the way of his professional duty. 'I had a great time at Chelsea and I have a lot of respect for the club and the people there,' he said. 'But I'm Stoke City manager now and my focus is on getting a result for us. We know it's a big challenge, but we're not going there to roll over. We're going there with belief and confidence that we can cause them problems.' Hughes added that he has been impressed by the work of his former team-mate Jose Mourinho, who has guided Chelsea to the top of the table and the quarter-finals of the Champions League. 'He's done a fantastic job, as he always does,' Hughes said. 'He's a winner and he knows how to win trophies. He's got a very strong squad and he's made some very astute signings. They're very hard to beat, especially at home, but we'll give it our best shot.'",
      "Outcome3": "Hughes, who scored 25 goals in 95 appearances for Chelsea between 1995 and 1998, knows how hard it is to get a result at Stamford Bridge. He admits the hosts are in formidable form, but insists his players will not be daunted by the challenge. 'They are looking very strong at the moment,' he said. 'They are top of the league, have a good lead and don't look like they are going to slip up. 'But we have good players as well, and good players enjoy testing themselves against the best.' While Chelsea have a virtually fully-fit squad to choose from, Hughes has a few injury concerns ahead of the game.",

One of the players who could make a difference for Stoke is striker Mame Biram Diouf, who scored a stunning solo goal in their 2-1 win at Manchester City in August. Diouf said: 'We have nothing to lose. We know they are a very good team, but we have shown before that we can cause problems to any team in this league. We just have to believe in ourselves and play our game.'",
      "Outcome5": "Hughes has fond memories of his time at Chelsea as a player, when he helped them win the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup in the 1990s. He also faced Stoke as a Blues player in that 1995 League Cup defeat and recalled: 'I remember playing against them and Eddie actually being my first-team coach at Chelsea on the day.

      "Outcome6": "Hughes has fond memories of his time at Chelsea, where he scored 39 goals in 123 appearances and won the FA Cup and the European Cup Winners' Cup in the mid-1990s. He admits he still has great affection for his former club, but insists that will not stop him from trying to cause an upset on Saturday. 'It was a wonderful period in my career,' Hughes said. 'I had four fantastic years under Glenn Hoddle and Ruud Gullit, who were really influential managers at the time, and I loved every minute of it. It's a great club and I have a lot of friends there still. 'But we're in opposition now and we'll go there with the intention of making life difficult for them. We know they are a quality side and they have the potential to win the league this year, but we have shown what we can do against the top teams and we'll give it a good go.'"

      "Right": "Beaten FA Cup semi-finalists Reading lost again as they were defeated by Birmingham in a scrappy Sky Bet Championship game at the Madejski Stadium on Wednesday night. Although Reading dominated most of the match, they wasted several chances in the closing stages of the first half. Birmingham held firm and grabbed the winner seven minutes from the end, when Clayton Donaldson nodded in his 16th goal of the season. Clayton Donaldson (left) scored a late headed winner for Birmingham City as his side defeated Reading 1-0 . Donaldson, who signed from Brentford in the summer, scored his 16th goal of the season . READING: Federici, Gunter, Cooper, Hector, Ake, McCleary (Appiah 63), Karacan, Chalobah, Obita, Mackie (Stacey 63), Blackman (Novakovich 81) Subs not used: Kelly, Norwood, Akpan, Andersen .

Referee: Lee Mason . Attendance: 14,604 . Reading were involved in a dramatic 2-1 defeat against Arsenal, after extra-time, in the last four of the Cup at Wembley on Saturday. Goalkeeper Adam Federici, whose fumble led to Alexis Sanchez's winning goal, was retained against Birmingham - as were six of his fellow starters from Wembley. At least Reading had no pressure on them, the last lingering doubts of relegation having been removed when Millwall lost 2-0 at Blackburn Rovers on Tuesday night. Birmingham had little to play for either, apart from trying to improve on a poor recent record of just two wins in eight league matches. A predictably dour opening, with neither side keen to force the pace, ended when Wes Thomas aimed at Federici. But it was a weak effort that did not trouble the Australian goalkeeper. Reading, with only two wins in 13 league games behind them and no wins in six, responded swiftly as the game warmed up. Garath McCleary, scorer of Reading's equaliser against Arsenal, fired wide after a long pass from Jake Cooper. A Cooper header lacked the power to test Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph, Jamie Mackie shot wide after Jem Karacan had been blocked out, and Mackie and Nick Blackman had close-range efforts cleared to safety. Randolph made a flying save to keep out a fierce McCleary shot and the keeper also had to stop two decent long-range attempts from Nathaniel Chalobah. Reading fans showed their support for Adam Federci following his blunder at Wembley on Saturday "

The hosts missed a series of chances in the first half, while Birmingham defended resolutely and snatched a late goal through Clayton Donaldson. The result left Reading in 19th place in the Championship table, while Birmingham moved up to 12th.",
      "Outcome3": "Reading controlled the first half against Birmingham but failed to score despite creating several chances. The hosts, who lost the FA Cup semi-final to Arsenal in extra-time, tested Randolph with shots from McCleary, Chalobah and Cooper, but could not break the deadlock. Birmingham rarely threatened, with Thomas having their only shot on target.",
      "Outcome4": "Despite their dominance, Reading could not find a breakthrough and were made to pay for their profligacy when Birmingham snatched the three points late on. A corner from substitute Lloyd Dyer was met by Donaldson, who rose above the Reading defence to head past Federici. Reading tried to rally, but their best chance fell to debutant Andrija Novakovich, who blazed over. The result leaves Reading 19th in the table, nine points above the relegation zone with two games left. They will hope to end their disappointing season on a high note when they face Rotherham and Derby. Birmingham climb to 11th, seven points behind the play-off places with three games remaining. They will look to build on their victory when they face Charlton, Watford and Bolton.",
      "Outcome5": "The second half began in similar fashion, with Reading on the front foot and Birmingham content to sit back and soak up the pressure. Federici had little to do, apart from gathering an easy shot from Diego Fabbrini, who had replaced the injured Diego Fabbrini before the break. Reading continued to create chances, but their finishing let them down. Craig Bryson headed wide from a good cross by Nathan Ake, Blackman missed the target from close range, and substitute Kwesi Appiah fired over from a promising position.",
      "Outcome6": "But Reading could not sustain their pressure after the interval and Birmingham gradually came more into the game. They created few chances but defended stoutly, with Jonathan Spector and Michael Morrison in commanding form at the back. Reading were reduced to hopeful long balls and crosses that were easily dealt with by Randolph and his defence."

      "Right": "Atletico Madrid striker Fernando Torres believes coach Diego Simeone's clear understanding of the team's weaknesses has been the key to their success as they seek revenge against Real Madrid on Tuesday for last season's Champions League final defeat. With the determined Argentine at the helm, Atletico have belied their economic inferiority to become one of the most dangerous sides in Europe and now the La Liga champions take on Real aiming once again for a place in the semi-finals of the continent's elite competition. In the past Atletico were accustomed to being swept aside by the footballing aristocrats, who claimed their 10th European crown against them in Lisbon, but now they are more than capable of trading blows. Fernando Torres (centre) scored his first ever league own goal during the 2-2 draw with Malaga on Saturday . Torres has praised the coaching style of Atletico Madrid manager Diego Simeone (centre) In fact since that final, when Atletico were agonisingly close to a victory before a Sergio Ramos header forced extra-time and then Real ran away with the match, Simeone's side has had the upper hand in the Madrid clashes. Atletico beat Real to win the season's Super Cup curtain-raiser, knocked them out of the King's Cup and defeated them in both La Liga clashes. The manner of their 4-0 demolition of Real in February's league meeting even led to questions about the future of coach Carlo Ancelotti. 'It is his character as a player and his character as a coach that drives the team,' Torres told UEFA.com of Simeone. Antoine Griezmann scored twice to help Diego Simeone's side scrape to a 2-2 draw on Saturday . Mario Mandzukic (left) celebrates with Torres after scoring in the 4-0 win over Real Madrid in February . Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates his strike with team-mates during the 3-0 win over Eibar . August 19 - Real 1-1 Atletico "

    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Despite Atletico's impressive record against their city rivals this season, they cannot afford to be complacent ahead of the quarter-final tie. Real Madrid have shown signs of recovery in recent weeks, with Cristiano Ronaldo back on top form and Gareth Bale finding his feet again. The European champions know how to raise their game for the big occasions, and they will be eager to avenge their domestic losses and maintain their hopes of becoming the first team to retain the Champions League trophy.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the most anticipated matches of the Champions League quarter-finals is the Madrid derby between Atletico and Real, who will face each other for the eighth time this season on Tuesday. The two rivals have a long and bitter history, dating back to the 1950s when Real dominated European football and Atletico were relegated to the second division. But the balance of power has shifted recently, with Atletico winning their first La Liga title in 18 years last season and coming within minutes of lifting the Champions League trophy, only to be denied by a late Real equaliser and a crushing defeat in extra-time. Since then, Atletico have had the upper hand over their neighbours, beating them in every competition except the Champions League, where they will seek revenge and a place in the semi-finals.",
      "Outcome3": "Atletico have improved under Simeone's guidance because he has instilled a strong work ethic, a solid defensive organisation, and a counter-attacking style that exploits the pace and power of his forwards. He has also given the team a clear identity and a sense of unity and confidence, as they challenge the traditional dominance of Real Madrid and Barcelona. What makes them a tough opponent for Real Madrid is their physicality, their intensity, and their ability to frustrate and disrupt their rivals' rhythm and creativity. They have also shown a mental edge over Real Madrid in recent clashes, as they have overcome the trauma of the Champions League final defeat and proved that they can beat them in different competitions and scenarios.",
      "Outcome4": "The heavy defeat to Atletico in February was a low point for Real Madrid, who faced criticism from fans and media for their lacklustre performance and lack of cohesion. Since then, the team has recovered some of its form and confidence, winning seven of its last eight games in all competitions and keeping pace with Barcelona at the top of La Liga. Real Madrid also have a formidable record in the Champions League, having won 10 of their last 11 matches, scoring 37 goals and conceding only nine. However, they face a stern test against their arch-rivals on Tuesday, as they have to cope with several injuries and the pressure of defending their title. Real Madrid are without Luka Modric, who suffered a knee ligament injury against Malaga, and Gareth Bale, who has a strained calf. They are also missing James Rodriguez, who is recovering from a broken foot, and Sergio Ramos, who is suspended for the first leg. These absences could weaken Real's midfield and defence, and force Ancelotti to reshuffle his line-up and tactics. Real Madrid will need to rely on their star players, such as Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored his 50th goal of the season against Eibar on Saturday, and Karim Benzema, who has formed a deadly partnership with the Portuguese forward. They will also need to show more intensity, discipline and concentration than they did in their previous encounters with Atletico, who have proved to be a tough and resilient opponent under Simeone. Real Madrid will have to break down Atletico's compact and organised defence, avoid giving away cheap fouls and set-pieces, and defend well against Atletico's counter-attacks and aerial threats. Real Madrid have the quality and experience to overcome Atletico, but they will have to work hard and play smart to do so.",
      "Outcome5": "After that humiliating defeat, Real have bounced back with a nine-match winning streak in all competitions, including a 3-0 victory over Eibar on Saturday that kept them within four points of leaders Barcelona in La Liga. They will be eager to prove themselves against their city rivals and reclaim their European supremacy. But Atletico are not easily intimidated and have shown great resilience and consistency this season, despite losing some key players in the summer. They also salvaged a 2-2 draw with Malaga on Saturday thanks to two goals from Antoine Griezmann, who has formed a potent partnership with Mario Mandzukic up front. The first leg of their quarter-final clash at the Vicente Calderon promises to be a fierce and fascinating encounter between two contrasting styles and philosophies.",
      "Outcome6": "The return of Torres to the club where he made his name has added another ingredient to the intriguing rivalry, which resumes with the first leg of the quarter-final at the Vicente Calderon on Tuesday. The former Liverpool and Chelsea forward scored in both legs of the last-16 victory over Bayer Leverkusen and hopes to end his personal drought against Real, having never netted against them in a competitive game. 'We know how difficult it is to play against them but also that we can beat them,' Torres said. 'It will be different to last year when they were almost unstoppable. Now things have changed a lot.'"

      "Outcome1": "April Fools' Day is a tradition of joking and pranking that dates back to the 16th century, but it is not always a laughing matter when it involves public servants and their livelihoods. The stunt that was pulled by a DFAT staff member on Wednesday, telling 30 colleagues that they were going to lose their jobs unless they relocated to Melbourne, was a cruel and insensitive hoax that caused distress and anger among the affected workers. It was also a breach of the code of conduct and ethics that governs the behaviour of public servants, who are expected to act with respect, integrity, and accountability in their roles. The prankster has been reprimanded by the department and may face further disciplinary action.\n\nThis is not the first time that April Fools' Day jokes have gone wrong in the public sector, and they should be avoided altogether. In 2013, the National Archives of Australia posted a fake document on its website, claiming that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd had been born in China and adopted by an Australian family. The prank sparked confusion and outrage among some members of the public and the media, who questioned the credibility and security of the archives. In 2010, the New Zealand Ministry of Health sent out a press release, announcing that it would introduce compulsory health and fitness tests for all public servants, and those who failed would be fired. The joke backfired, as some employees believed it was true and felt insulted and humiliated by the suggestion.\n\nThese examples show that April Fools' Day jokes in the public sector are not appropriate or professional, and can have negative consequences for the reputation and morale of the organisations and the individuals involved. They can also undermine the trust and confidence of the public in the government and its services. Therefore, public servants should refrain from making or participating in any pranks that could harm, offend, or mislead anyone, and instead focus on performing their duties with honesty, competence, and courtesy.",
      "Outcome2": "- The staff who received the shocking news on April Fools' Day had no reason to suspect it was a joke. They had been working hard for the department, some for many years, and were blindsided by the sudden announcement that their workplace was being shut down and relocated. The prank showed a lack of respect and empathy for their feelings and circumstances, as they faced the prospect of losing their jobs or uprooting their lives.\n- It was supposed to be a harmless joke, but it turned out to be a nightmare for the staff who saw the message on the screen. They had devoted their careers to the department, and were loyal and committed to their work. The prank was cruel and insensitive, as it implied that their contributions were not valued and that they could be easily disposed of. The staff felt betrayed and humiliated by the prankster, who did not consider the impact of his or her actions on their morale and wellbeing.\n- The prank went too far, as it played with the emotions and livelihoods of the staff who read the announcement. They had been serving the department faithfully, and had built relationships and networks in Canberra. The prank was rude and insensitive, as it mocked their dedication and professionalism, and threatened their job security and stability. The staff were outraged and hurt by the prank, which showed a disregard and contempt for their situation and dignity.",
      "Outcome3": "A DFAT employee played a prank on 30 colleagues by telling them their jobs were being relocated to Melbourne on April Fools' Day. The prank caused distress and anger among the staff, who later found out it was a hoax. The prankster has been reprimanded by the department, and the staff members have been offered an apology and counselling.",
      "Outcome4": "- One of the staff members, who wished to remain anonymous, said they were shocked and angry when they saw the announcement. \"I thought it was a very insensitive and irresponsible joke, especially in these times of uncertainty and job insecurity. I spent the whole morning trying to figure out how to tell my family and friends that I had to move to another city or look for a new job.\"\n- \"It was not funny at all, it was disrespectful and cruel,\" said another staff member, who also did not want to be named. \"We work hard to serve our country and we deserve better than this. Some of us have families, mortgages, and commitments here in Canberra. How can someone think this is a good idea for an April Fools' prank?\"\n- A third staff member, who identified herself as Sarah, said she was in tears when she saw the announcement. \"I love my job and I love Canberra, I have no intention of moving to Melbourne. I was so scared and confused, I didn't know what to do. I called my supervisor and he told me it was a prank, but I was still shaken by it. It was a horrible thing to do to us.\"",
      "Outcome5": "The prankster, who has not been named, apparently thought it would be a funny joke to create a fake slide with the DFAT logo and the headline 'New DFAT Office in Melbourne'. The slide claimed that the move was part of a 'regionalisation strategy' and that staff had until 5pm that day to submit their expressions of interest. The unsuspecting workers were shocked and upset by the news, which they believed was real. Some even started making phone calls to their families and friends to discuss their options.",

      "Right": "(CNN)A top al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leader -- who a few years ago was in a U.S. detention facility -- was among five killed in an airstrike in Yemen, the terror group said, showing the organization is vulnerable even as Yemen appears close to civil war. Ibrahim al-Rubaish died Monday night in what AQAP's media wing, Al-Malahem Media, called a \"crusader airstrike.\"  The Al-Malahem Media obituary characterized al-Rubaish as a religious scholar and combat commander. A Yemeni Defense Ministry official and two Yemeni national security officials not authorized to speak on record confirmed that al-Rubaish had been killed, but could not specify how he died. Al-Rubaish was once held by the U.S. government at its detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In fact, he was among a number of detainees who sued the administration of then-President George W. Bush to challenge the legality of their confinement in Gitmo. He was eventually released as part of Saudi Arabia's program for rehabilitating jihadist terrorists, a program that U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, characterized as \"a failure.\" In December 2009, Sessions listed al-Rubaish among those on the virtual \" 'Who's Who' of al Qaeda terrorists on the Arabian peninsula ... who have either graduated or escaped from the program en route to terrorist acts.\" The United States has been active in Yemen, working closely with governments there to go after AQAP leaders like al-Rubaish. While it was not immediately clear how he died, drone strikes have killed many other members of the terrorist group. Yemen, however, has been in disarray since Houthi rebels began asserting themselves last year. The Shiite minority group even managed to take over the capital of Sanaa and, in January, force out Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi -- who had been a close U.S. ally in its anti-terror fight. Hadi still claims he is Yemen's legitimate leader, and he is working with a Saudi-led military coalition to target Houthis and supporters of former President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Meanwhile, Yemen has been awash in violence and chaos -- which in some ways has been good for groups such as AQAP. A prison break earlier this month freed 270 prisoners, including some senior AQAP figures, according to a senior Defense Ministry official, and the United States pulled the last of its special operations forces out of Yemen last month, which some say makes things easier for AQAP"

      "Prompt6": "Insert a passage connecting the two passages"
    },
    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Al-Rubaish's death is a significant blow to AQAP, as he was one of the most senior and influential leaders of the group. He was not only a religious scholar who issued fatwas and justified attacks against the West, but also a combat commander who participated in planning and executing operations, such as the failed attempt to blow up a U.S.-bound airliner on Christmas Day 2009. He was also instrumental in forging ties with other jihadist groups in the region, such as the Islamic State and Boko Haram. His loss deprives AQAP of a charismatic and experienced figure who could recruit, train, and inspire new members and supporters. Moreover, his death could create a leadership vacuum and trigger internal disputes among the remaining AQAP commanders, especially at a time when the group faces increased pressure from the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi rebels. However, al-Rubaish's death does not necessarily mean the end of AQAP's threat, as the group has shown resilience and adaptability in the past, and still has a loyal and dedicated base of followers and operatives. AQAP may also seek to avenge al-Rubaish's death by launching more attacks against its enemies, both in Yemen and abroad. Therefore, al-Rubaish's death should be seen as a setback, but not a decisive victory, in the fight against AQAP.",
      "Outcome2": "- Al Qaeda leader Ibrahim al-Rubaish was killed in an airstrike in Yemen, according to AQAP and Yemeni officials.\n- Al-Rubaish was a former Guantanamo Bay detainee who escaped from a Saudi rehabilitation program and became a top religious and military figure in AQAP, the group behind several terror plots.\n- His death shows that AQAP is still targeted by the U.S. and its allies, despite the ongoing civil war in Yemen between the Houthi rebels and the government of President Hadi, who fled Sanaa after a coup.",
      "Outcome3": "Ibrahim al-Rubaish was a prominent leader and ideologue of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), the Yemen-based branch of the global terrorist network. He played a key role in inspiring and directing attacks against Western and Yemeni targets, as well as issuing religious rulings to justify AQAP's violent agenda. He was also a close associate of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric who was killed by a U.S. drone strike in 2011.\n\nAl-Rubaish was originally captured by U.S. forces in Afghanistan in 2001, and transferred to the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, where he was held without trial for five years. He was among several detainees who filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government, challenging the legality of their indefinite detention. In 2006, he was released to Saudi Arabia, where he was supposed to undergo a rehabilitation program for former militants. However, he soon escaped from Saudi custody and fled to Yemen, where he joined AQAP and rose to become one of its senior leaders. He became a vocal critic of the Saudi regime and its alliance with the United States, and urged other jihadists to join the fight against them. He also denounced the Houthi rebels who have taken over large parts of Yemen, and called for Sunni Muslims to resist their advance.",
      "Outcome4": "The death of al-Rubaish is a significant blow to AQAP, which has been behind several plots against the U.S. and its allies, including the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner in 2009 and the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris earlier this year. Al-Rubaish was not only a senior leader, but also a prominent ideologue and recruiter for the group, whose videos and statements often praised Osama bin Laden and called for attacks on the West. However, his elimination does not mean that AQAP is defeated, as the group still has other experienced commanders and operatives, and may exploit the chaos and instability in Yemen to regroup and expand its reach. The U.S. counterterrorism strategy in Yemen and the region faces major challenges, as it has lost a key partner in Hadi, and has limited intelligence and operational capabilities on the ground. The U.S. will have to rely more on drone strikes, regional allies, and local forces to contain and degrade AQAP, while also supporting a political solution to end the conflict and restore stability in Yemen.",
      "Outcome5": "Amid the unrest in Yemen, AQAP has seized opportunities to expand its operations and attack its enemies. The group claimed responsibility for the deadly assault on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in January, saying it was in revenge for its cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. It also threatened more attacks on Western targets, especially the United States, which it considers as the main \"crusader\" force against Islam. Al-Rubaish was one of the main ideologues and spokesmen of AQAP, often appearing in its propaganda videos and issuing statements online.",
      "Outcome6": "The U.S. withdrawal of its forces was a blow to the anti-AQAP campaign, as they had been providing intelligence, training and logistical support to Yemeni counterterrorism units. Without their presence, the Yemeni forces have struggled to contain the AQAP threat, which has exploited the power vacuum and instability created by the Houthi rebellion. AQAP has launched attacks on Houthi targets, government institutions and foreign interests, as well as expanding its control over territory in southern and eastern Yemen."

      "Outcome1": "Chris Jans was an accomplished basketball coach who had led Bowling Green to a 21-12 record in his first season. He had previously worked as an assistant coach at Wichita State, where he helped the Shockers reach the Final Four in 2013 and win 35 consecutive games in 2014. He had also been a head coach at junior college and Division II levels, winning several championships and awards. He was hired by Bowling Green in March 2014 with a six-year contract worth $325,000 annually.",
      "Outcome2": "Jans' dismissal from Bowling Green has significant implications for both the basketball program and his personal life. As the head coach, Jans was responsible for leading the team to success on and off the court, recruiting new talent, and maintaining a positive image for the university. His behavior at the bar violated the standards of conduct and ethics expected of him, and damaged his reputation and credibility. He also lost the trust and respect of his players, staff, and fans, who may feel betrayed or disappointed by his actions.\n\nThe basketball program will have to find a new coach who can take over the reins and rebuild the morale and culture of the team. This may not be an easy task, as the program may face challenges in attracting qualified candidates or retaining current players who may want to transfer. The program may also face sanctions or lawsuits from the NCAA, the university, or the victims of Jans' misconduct, which could affect its financial resources and performance.\n\nJans' personal life will also suffer from the consequences of his drunken night out. As a married father-of-two, he will have to deal with the impact of his infidelity and disrespect on his family and marriage. He may face divorce, custody issues, or estrangement from his spouse and children, who may feel hurt, angry, or ashamed by his behavior. He may also struggle to find employment or support in the basketball community, as he may be seen as a liability or a pariah. He may need to seek professional help or counseling to address his alcohol problem or other underlying issues that may have contributed to his poor judgment.",
      "Outcome3": "Bowling Green University strives to uphold the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and respect for all members of its community. The conduct of Chris Jans, the former basketball coach, at a local bar on March 21 was unacceptable and violated these values. He acted inappropriately and aggressively towards several women, touching them without their consent, making lewd gestures, and using abusive language. He also embarrassed the university and tarnished its reputation by his drunken behavior in public. Such actions are not only offensive and disrespectful to the women involved, but also to the students, staff, alumni, and supporters of Bowling Green University. As a coach, he was expected to be a role model and a leader, not a source of shame and scandal. Therefore, the university had no choice but to fire him and sever any ties with him.",
      "Outcome4": "After receiving the letter and the video from the concerned parents, the university launched an investigation into Jans' actions. They interviewed several witnesses who were at the bar that night, including staff, patrons, and members of the basketball team. They also reviewed security footage from the bar and obtained a copy of the receipt that showed Jans had spent $437 on alcohol. The university found that Jans had violated the code of conduct and the zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment and violence. They also determined that he had damaged the reputation and integrity of the university and the athletics department. Based on the evidence, the university decided to terminate Jans' contract effective immediately. They announced their decision in a press release and apologized to the victims and the community for Jans' behavior. They also thanked the parents for bringing the matter to their attention and expressed their commitment to creating a safe and respectful environment for everyone.",
      "Outcome5": "It was not long before another woman became the target of Jans' drunken advances. A video clip captured by a fellow patron shows him touching her behind as she stands next to her husband at the bar. The couple, who were unaware of Jans' identity, were shocked and disgusted by his behavior. They confronted him and asked him to stop, but he ignored them and continued to act inappropriately. The husband then took out his phone and recorded the incident, hoping to expose the coach's misconduct. He later sent the footage to the university along with a complaint letter.",
      "Outcome6": ". The woman pulled away and slapped him. The incident did not seem to deter Jans, who continued his inappropriate conduct throughout the night. 'He also slapped a woman on her behind, called another woman a 'b****', and made obscene gestures with his tongue. We were shocked and disgusted by his behavior, and felt sorry for his wife and children who must have to deal with him.'"

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "The new contract for Ibe is a sign of Liverpool's faith in the young winger, who has shown his pace, skill, and versatility since returning from a loan spell at Derby County. Ibe is seen as one of the bright prospects for the future, along with Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho, and Emre Can. However, Liverpool face some challenges and opportunities in the remainder of the season and beyond, as they aim to secure a place in Europe and rebuild their squad. The Reds are currently fifth in the Premier League, seven points behind fourth-placed Manchester City, but with a game in hand. They also have a chance to win the FA Cup, having reached the semi-finals, where they will face Aston Villa at Wembley. Manager Brendan Rodgers will hope to end the season on a high note, after suffering a disappointing exit from the Champions League and the League Cup earlier in the campaign. He will also look to strengthen his squad in the summer, with reports linking him with moves for Memphis Depay, James Milner, and Danny Ings. Liverpool will have to contend with the uncertainty over the future of Sterling, who has stalled on signing a new contract, and the departure of their captain and legend Steven Gerrard, who will join LA Galaxy at the end of the season. Liverpool will also have to adjust to their new shirt sponsor, Standard Chartered, who have agreed a lucrative three-year deal with the club. Liverpool will hope that their new deals, both on and off the pitch, will help them compete with the top teams in England and Europe, and restore their glory days at Anfield.",
      "Outcome2": "The winger's new contract is a sign of Liverpool's faith in his potential and their commitment to securing the future of their young talent. Ibe is not the only player who will be rewarded with improved terms in the coming days, as the club are keen to tie down two of their key performers this season.",
      "Outcome3": "By securing the futures of Ibe and other promising talents, Liverpool are showing their commitment to building a strong and competitive team for the years ahead. Ibe has been tipped as one of the brightest prospects in English football, and his pace, skill and versatility have added a new dimension to Liverpool's attack. His new contract will ward off any potential suitors and allow him to develop under Brendan Rodgers' guidance.\n\nLiverpool are also keen to reward the loyalty and leadership of Henderson, who has emerged as the captain-in-waiting after Steven Gerrard's departure. The midfielder has been a consistent performer and an influential figure in the dressing room, and his new contract will reflect his importance to the club. Meanwhile, Skrtel has been a rock at the back for Liverpool, and his new deal will ensure that he remains part of the defensive core for the foreseeable future.\n\nFinally, Liverpool are also hopeful of keeping Flanagan, who has been sidelined for most of the season with a knee injury. The full-back impressed last season with his tenacity and work-rate, and Rodgers has expressed his admiration for his character and attitude. Flanagan is keen to stay at his boyhood club, and Liverpool are willing to offer him a new contract despite his fitness concerns.\n\nBy tying down these key players, Liverpool are demonstrating their ambition and long-term vision. They are looking to build a squad that can challenge for trophies and honors, and create a blend of experience and youth. They are also investing in the home-grown talent that has been nurtured at the academy, and fostering a sense of identity and pride. Liverpool are confident that they have a bright future ahead, and they want their stars to be part of it.",
      "Outcome4": "- Ibe has shown his versatility and talent in a number of positions, including winger, wing-back, and central midfielder, adding depth and dynamism to Brendan Rodgers' squad.\n- The youngster has also impressed with his pace, dribbling, and work-rate, creating chances and scoring a stunning solo goal against Blackburn in the FA Cup quarter-final replay.\n- Ibe, who joined Liverpool from Wycombe Wanderers in 2012, is seen as one of the brightest prospects in English football and has already earned praise from Rodgers, Steven Gerrard, and Raheem Sterling.\n- By securing his long-term future, Liverpool are demonstrating their faith and ambition in nurturing Ibe's development and ensuring he fulfils his potential at Anfield.",
      "Outcome5": "The new contract is a reward for Ibe's impressive progress since joining Liverpool from Wycombe Wanderers in 2012. The winger, who has been compared to Raheem Sterling, has shown his pace, skill and versatility on both flanks under Brendan Rodgers.",
      "Outcome6": ". The winger, who joined Liverpool from Wycombe Wanderers in 2012, has shown his potential under Brendan Rodgers and is seen as a key part of the club's future. He scored his first senior goal for Liverpool in the Europa League against Rubin Kazan in November, and has also impressed with his pace, dribbling and crossing ability."

Laughing before murder trial: Suge Knight and his lawyer Matthew Fletcher were jovial in court on Thursday . Lifeline? Knight's attorney said he believes Mayweather will bail the rap mogul out when he wins on Saturday ",
      "Right": ". Mayweather, an undefeated professional worth $420 million, is set to land a record pay check after going head-to-head with Manny Pacquiao on Saturday. Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher is confident part of that will come their way. 'My understanding is that Suge is going to be bailed out this coming week,' Fletcher told the New York Daily News outside court. 'We think Mr. Mayweather is going to win the championship and then come champion the day again,' he said. 'They're good friends, and there's no reason he shouldn't. And we believe that will happen.' Los Angeles Superior Court's Ronald Coen said Knight's trial will begin July 7 unless a motion is made to continue it for a later date. Appearing distressed, Knight then had to be wheeled out of court in a wheelchair after the hearing . The 48-year-old has been plagued by medical ailments since being charged with murder and attempted murder in January . Appearing distressed, Knight then had to be wheeled out of court in a wheelchair. The 48-year-old has been plagued by medical ailments since being charged with murder and attempted murder in January - collapsing in court multiple times and routinely complaining of stomach problems. Coen set aside 16 court days to hear the case and said potential jurors will be prescreened about their ability to serve before they get to the courtroom. Knight pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and hit-and-run charges filed after he killed one man and seriously injured another with his pickup outside a Compton burger stand in January."

      "Outcome2": "According to police and witnesses, the deadly incident occurred on January 29 at Tam's Burgers in Compton, where Knight had gone to meet with Dr. Dre and Ice Cube, the producers of the upcoming film \"Straight Outta Compton\". The movie depicts the rise and fall of N.W.A., the influential rap group that Knight had feuded with in the past. Knight was reportedly unhappy with his portrayal in the film and wanted compensation. However, an argument broke out between Knight and some men affiliated with Dr. Dre, including Terry Carter, a former rap label owner and friend of both Knight and Dre, and Cle \"Bone\" Sloan, an actor and former gang member. Knight then got into his red Ford F-150 Raptor truck and allegedly backed into Sloan, who was standing behind the vehicle, knocking him to the ground. He then put the truck in drive and ran over Sloan again, before hitting Carter, who was standing next to his own car, and dragging him for several feet. Knight then fled the scene. Carter was pronounced dead at a hospital, while Sloan suffered serious injuries to his head and body. Knight later turned himself in to the authorities and claimed he acted in self-defense, fearing for his life after being attacked by armed men. His lawyers also argued that he was legally blind in his left eye and did not see the victims.",
      "Outcome3": "The article reports on Suge Knight's court appearance, where he was denied a lower bail and had to be taken away in a wheelchair. He is facing murder and attempted murder charges for running over two men with his truck in January. He hopes that his friend Floyd Mayweather, who is fighting on Saturday, will bail him out of jail. His lawyer said they are confident of winning the trial, which is set to start in July. The article also gives some background information on Knight's health problems and his friendship with Mayweather.",
      "Outcome4": "Knight's bail is set at such a high amount because he is considered a flight risk and a danger to the community. He has a long criminal history, including convictions for assault and robbery, and he faces the possibility of life in prison if convicted of murder. He also violated the terms of his previous bail in 2014, when he failed to appear in court for a theft case. The prosecution argues that Knight intentionally ran over Terry Carter and Cle Sloan with his truck, after an altercation at the location where the film Straight Outta Compton was being shot. They have video footage of the incident, as well as eyewitness testimony and phone records, to support their claim. Knight claims he acted in self-defense, fearing for his life after being attacked by armed men. His lawyer says the video is inconclusive and that the witnesses are unreliable.",
      "Outcome5": "Knight's legal team argued that his bail was excessive and should be lowered to a reasonable amount, given his poor health and lack of flight risk. They also claimed that the prosecution's case was weak and based on unreliable witnesses and evidence. However, Judge Coen was not persuaded by their arguments and said he found probable cause to support the charges against Knight. He said Knight was a danger to the community and had a history of violence and intimidation.",
      "Outcome6": "Knight showed no signs of remorse or fear as he joked with his attorney Matthew Fletcher in the Los Angeles courtroom. He even waved to a CBS reporter and smiled for the cameras, seemingly unfazed by the serious charges he faces. He had hoped to convince the judge that his bail was excessive and should be lowered to match the $5 million bail set for another rap figure, Marion 'Snoop Dogg' Broadus, who was acquitted of murder in 1996. But Judge Coen was unmoved by his arguments, saying Knight's criminal history and potential flight risk justified the high amount. He also cited the graphic video of the incident, which showed Knight running over two men with his truck, as evidence of his violent tendencies. Knight's lawyers claimed he was acting in self-defense and fleeing an ambush, but the prosecution argued he deliberately targeted the victims after a confrontation."

What ensued was a night to forget for the former Chelsea man as he encountered ex-Liverpool ace Luis Suarez in an especially audacious mood for the Catalans, who take a 3-1 lead to the Nou Camp after the Uruguayan's deadly double. With his side already 1-0 down through the imposing combination of Lionel Messi and Neymar, the night went from bad to worse when Luiz pulled up his socks to take the pitch after 21 minutes"

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Luiz was brought back from injury despite not being fully fit because PSG faced a defensive crisis ahead of their crucial Champions League quarter-final clash against Barcelona. The French champions had already lost Silva to a thigh strain in the warm-up, and were left with only Marquinhos and Luiz as their available center-backs. Luiz had missed the last two games with a hamstring problem, but was deemed fit enough to be on the bench. However, when Silva could not continue, PSG coach Laurent Blanc had no option but to risk Luiz and hope that he could cope with Barcelona's formidable attack. Unfortunately, the gamble did not pay off, as Luiz was exposed by Suarez's pace, skill, and trickery.",
      "Outcome2": "Suarez displayed his world-class talent and tormented Luiz with his skill and movement, scoring two superb goals to put Barcelona in command of the tie. The first came just after the break, when he nutmegged the Brazilian defender with a sublime piece of skill on the right flank, before cutting inside and curling a left-footed shot past Salvatore Sirigu. The second was even more humiliating for Luiz, as Suarez ran at him from the halfway line, feinted to go outside, and then nutmegged him again with a cheeky backheel, before finishing calmly with his right foot. Luiz looked helpless and hapless as Suarez danced past him, exposing his lack of pace, awareness, and confidence. He was replaced by Gregory van der Wiel in the 66th minute, having endured one of the worst nights of his career.",
      "Outcome3": "Despite Luiz's efforts to contain Barcelona's formidable attack, he soon found himself on the wrong end of two stunning goals by Suarez that showcased his superb skill and composure.",
      "Outcome4": "PSG's defence suffered a blow when Silva had to leave the game due to injury and was replaced by Luiz, who was not fully fit. Luiz was tormented by Suarez, who scored two stunning goals to give Barcelona a commanding lead in the quarter-final. PSG also conceded to Messi and Neymar, who linked up well for the opener.",
      "Outcome5": "Luiz had been sidelined for a month with a hamstring injury, but was rushed back to the starting line-up by coach Laurent Blanc after Silva suffered a thigh problem in the warm-up. It was a gamble that did not pay off, as Luiz looked rusty and out of sync with his teammates, and was ruthlessly exposed by Suarez's pace, skill, and finishing.",
      "Outcome6": "Luiz, who had been sidelined for a month with a thigh injury, was deemed fit enough to start on the bench but was soon called into action when Silva suffered a hamstring problem in the early stages of the Champions League quarter-final first leg. The PSG fans hoped that Luiz's experience and passion would help them contain the formidable Barcelona attack, but their hopes were dashed as Suarez ran riot against the hapless defender in the second half."

      "Outcome1": "Toure and Nasri have both been accused of a lack of commitment and consistency throughout the season, as City have fallen behind in the title race and crashed out of the domestic cups and Europe. Toure, who turns 32 next month, has scored only eight goals in the league after hitting 20 last term, and has often looked sluggish and disinterested on the pitch. He also sparked controversy by criticising the club for not celebrating his birthday properly last summer, and hinted at a possible exit several times. Nasri, on the other hand, has struggled with injuries and form, making only 10 starts in the league and failing to score or assist a single goal. He was widely criticised for his timid display at Barcelona, where he was replaced at half-time, and has been involved in several bust-ups with team-mates and opponents.",
      "Outcome2": "City are ready to offload Toure and Nasri as part of a major overhaul of their squad after a disappointing campaign. Both players have struggled to perform consistently and have been seen as liabilities in key games. Toure, who turns 32 next month, is losing his influence and pace, while Nasri has been hampered by injuries and poor form. City want to cash in on them before they lose more value and free up space for new signings.",
      "Outcome3": "In a bid to revive their flagging fortunes, Manchester City are set to overhaul their squad and offload some of their star names this summer. The club are ready to listen to offers for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri, who have both disappointed in a dismal season that has seen them lose ground to their rivals. Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure this summer . The Premier League champions are also open to allowing Samir Nasri leave the Etihad Stadium . Toure will be made available before his value in the market dwindles. Nasri, meanwhile, has barely played since his lame showing in the Champions League at Barcelona.",
      "Outcome4": "Both Toure and Nasri joined City in 2011 and were instrumental in the club's first two Premier League titles, but their form and commitment have been questioned this season. Toure, who turns 32 next month, has attracted interest from Inter Milan, where his former boss Roberto Mancini is in charge. Nasri, 27, has been linked with a return to France, where PSG and Monaco could offer him a lucrative deal. City will look to reinvest the funds from their sales in younger and hungrier players, with Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba and Wolfsburg winger Kevin De Bruyne among their targets.",
      "Outcome5": "Perhaps one of the most disappointing players this season has been Nasri, who signed a new five-year contract worth £180,000-a-week last summer but has made little impact on the pitch. The Frenchman has been sidelined with injury for much of the campaign, but even when fit he has struggled to recapture the form that saw him score 11 goals and provide 12 assists last term. Nasri's attitude has also been questioned by some of his team-mates, who feel he does not work hard enough defensively or show enough commitment to the club. |end response|",
      "Outcome6": "Toure, who turns 32 next month, was instrumental in City’s title triumphs in 2012 and 2014, but his form and commitment have been questioned this season. The Ivorian has scored only eight goals in the league, half of his tally last year, and has often looked disinterested and sluggish on the pitch. Toure’s agent Dimitri Seluk has also stirred up trouble by repeatedly criticising City and Pellegrini, and claiming that his client is unhappy at the club. It is understood that City have decided to cut their losses and sell Toure while he still commands a high price, rather than risk keeping a discontented player whose value could plummet."

This exposes the fragility of Miliband's appeal to the diverse and progressive voters he needs to win the election.

      "Outcome3": "Earlier that day, Bethany Rutter, a plus-sized blogger and journalist who goes by the name Arched Eyebrow, had joined 200 other celebrities and public figures in signing an open letter endorsing Ed Miliband as the next prime minister. The letter, published in The Guardian, praised Miliband's vision for a fairer and more equal society, and urged voters to support Labour in the upcoming election. Rutter was among the signatories who appeared with Miliband at an event in London, where he thanked them for their backing and posed for photos.\n\nHowever, as she watched the seven-way leaders' debate on ITV later that night, Rutter had a change of heart. Instead of tweeting her support for Miliband, she expressed her admiration for Natalie Bennett, the leader of the Green Party, who shared many of her views on issues such as feminism, social justice, and environmentalism. Rutter tweeted: \"Natalie Bennett has been great tonight. She's said a lot of things I agree with and care about.\" She also retweeted several messages from other users who praised Bennett's performance and criticised Miliband's lack of charisma and conviction. Rutter's tweets caused a stir on social media, as some accused her of being disloyal and opportunistic, while others applauded her honesty and independence. By the end of the night, Rutter had effectively switched her allegiance from Labour to the Greens, leaving Miliband with one less celebrity supporter.",
      "Outcome4": "On Friday, Stephanie Yeboah, a plus-sized fashion blogger who has over 40,000 followers on Instagram, announced that she had changed her mind about supporting Labour and would vote for the Greens instead. She said she was disappointed by Miliband's lack of policies on social justice, climate change, and animal rights, and felt betrayed by his stance on immigration and austerity. Yeboah, who was one of the signatories of a letter published in The Guardian on Thursday morning, endorsing Miliband as the best choice for women, said she had been misled by Labour's campaign and regretted signing the letter. Her U-turn dealt a major blow to Miliband's efforts to appeal to young and female voters, who are seen as crucial for his chances of winning the election. It also raised questions about his credibility and authenticity, as he had proudly showcased Yeboah's endorsement as a sign of his progressive and inclusive vision. Some political commentators suggested that Yeboah's switch reflected a wider disillusionment among the so-called \"Miliband generation\", who had initially been attracted by his promise of change, but later became frustrated by his lack of substance and charisma.",

      "Left": "The family of conjoined twin sisters who died 19 days after they were born have been left mortified after they arrived at their gravesite to find cemetery staff had cleared the baby section of all mementos and tossed them in the rubbish. Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus. They died in hospital less than a month after they were born and their parents, Simon Howie and Renee Young, laid them to rest at Pinegrove Memorial Park in Sydney's west. Scroll down for video . Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus . Family members have visited the grave every week to leave mementos and flowers for Faith and Hope, but when Mr Howie and Ms Young arrived on Thursday they found the site completely bare. 'We took Renee's aunts to see the girls for the first time and we found everything had been stripped away,' Mr Howie told Daily Mail Australia. 'We were devastated and mortified. We've had a little shrine set up and we've been adding to it since the funeral. 'It's heartbreaking to know we've set this up and it has been treated like rubbish.' Faith and Hope were buried in a pink coffin and their family and friends released doves and pink and white balloons at their funeral. Their family and friends had built up a small memorial with pink and white statues, flowers, pebbles and toys over the past 11 months. When they arrived on Thursday, everything had been removed apart from a bunch of flowers. The twins were buried at Pinegrove Memorial Park in western Sydney after they died after just 19 days. Their family and friends had built a small shrine at their gravesite, which they have added to since the funeral . Family members have visited the grave every week to leave mementos and flowers for Faith and Hope, but when parents Simon Howie and Renee Young arrived on Thursday they found the site completely bare . Faith and Hope's parents confronted staff from the cemetery and were told they were supposed to have been notified they are would be cleaned. They found their daughters' belongings in nearby rubbish bins, but were only able to retrieve about 25 percent of their memorabilia. 'There was no warning, it was just manhandled and thrown in the rubbish. It was through the entire baby section.' The couple retrieved what they could find and returned later in the afternoon to see what else they could salvage - by then everything had been laid out on shelves for people to collect. 'We've gone down there and maintained it. We make sure either side of the girls is clipped with scissors to (workers) don't need to go near it,' Mr Howie said. He said there was no reason for the items to be taken away.

They found their daughters' belongings in nearby rubbish bins, but were only able to retrieve about 25 percent of their memorabilia (pictured) The couple retrieved what they could find and returned later in the afternoon to see what else they could salvage - by then everything had been laid out on shelves for people to collect . 'We pay the money to have the plot, they should be able to just take little mementos. It's just not fair on the families,' Mr Howie said. 'We got to those places to grieve - we're only one month out from the girls turning one... and it's been stripped naked. We have to start again. 'It obviously meant nothing to (the workers). I understand they have a job to do, but this is somebody else's loved one.' Pinegrove has offered an apology to the families affected. Faith and Hope were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and organs but have separate brains and two faces . The girls were transferred to Westmead Children's Hospital shortly after their birth on May 8 where they were closely monitored by doctors and nurses . They passed away just 19 days after they were born - their condition was so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none survived . 'The collection and storage of ornaments, especially photos, should have been handled much more respectfully and our goal is to improve it for the future,' Pinegrove's communication manager Karl Wolfenden said. 'We do understand the emotions of affected families. We have apologised to those we have spoken to and we have invited them to meet so we can find a solution that is agreeable to all. We are inviting other affected families to make contact also. 'Pinegrove is a fresh flower only and no ornamentation park but despite our rules and regulations we should have shown more respect to these items. 'We will discuss and seek an agreeable solution with families in the weeks ahead.' Faith and Hope's parents have set up an online petition to have the rules and regulations at cemetery's changed to ensure memorial items are not removed without being notified.

      "Outcome1": "The parents of Faith and Hope were shocked and hurt by the removal of their mementos, because they felt that they had been treated with disrespect and disregard. The mementos were not just decorations, but symbols of their love and remembrance for their daughters, who had lived for only 19 days. The parents had created a shrine at their gravesite, where they could visit and pay tribute to their miracle twins, and share their story with their relatives and friends. The mementos also helped them cope with their loss, and mark important dates, such as the twins' birthday. By clearing the baby section of all ornaments, the cemetery staff had taken away part of their grieving process, and left them feeling violated and empty.",
      "Outcome2": "Faith and Hope Howie were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and organs but have separate brains and two faces. The condition is also known as craniofacial duplication, and it occurs when an embryo fails to divide properly in the early stages of development. Only 35 cases of diprosopus have ever been recorded in humans, and none of them survived.\n\nThe twins were delivered by caesarean section at Blacktown Hospital in Sydney on May 8, 2014, to parents Simon Howie and Renee Young, who already had seven other children. They were transferred to Westmead Children's Hospital shortly after their birth, where they were closely monitored by doctors and nurses. Despite the odds, they managed to breathe on their own and were able to be fed through a tube.\n\nTheir story captured the hearts of many people around the world, who followed their progress on social media and sent messages of support and prayers. Their parents described them as beautiful and perfect, and said they were blessed to have them. They gave them the middle names Alice and Louise, after the sisters of Mr Howie who died in a house fire as children.\n\nSadly, Faith and Hope passed away just 19 days after they were born, on May 27, 2014. Their parents said they were at peace and thanked everyone for their love and kindness. They laid them to rest at Pinegrove Memorial Park in western Sydney, where hundreds of mourners attended their funeral.",
      "Outcome3": "The cemetery's communication manager admitted that the removal of ornaments and photos from the baby section was disrespectful and apologized to the affected families. He invited them to meet and find a solution that would respect their wishes. The cemetery has a policy of only allowing fresh flowers and no other memorabilia, but said they would discuss and seek an alternative with the families. Faith and Hope's parents have launched an online petition to ask for more flexibility and notification in the cemetery's rules and regulations.",
      "Outcome4": "- 'It was like a slap in the face. They've taken away our memories and our way of honouring our girls.' - Renee Young, mother\n- 'We feel violated and disrespected. They had no right to touch our stuff without telling us first. How would they like it if someone did that to their loved ones?' - Simon Howie, father\n- 'They were more than just ornaments, they were symbols of our love and our grief. We wanted to make their grave as beautiful and personal as we could.' - Janine Smith, aunt\n- 'They should have shown some compassion and understanding. We're not asking for much, just a bit of dignity and respect for our angels.' - David Howie, grandfather",
      "Outcome5": "- Despite the tragedy of losing their daughters, Mr Howie and Ms Young have been trying to keep their memory alive by visiting their gravesite regularly and decorating it with mementos. They were shocked and hurt when they discovered that someone had removed all their belongings and thrown them in the rubbish.\n- For Mr Howie and Ms Young, the gravesite of their daughters was a sacred place where they could mourn and remember them. They had lovingly placed statues, flowers, pebbles and toys around their pink coffin, creating a personal shrine. They never expected that the cemetery staff would clear everything away without warning and disrespect their wishes.\n- The cemetery staff had no idea how much pain they caused when they cleared the baby section of all ornaments, including those of Faith and Hope. Mr Howie and Ms Young had poured their love and grief into the small memorial they had built for their daughters, who had died after just 19 days. They felt violated and betrayed when they found their precious items in the rubbish bins.",
      "Outcome6": "The twins' parents said they felt blessed by the short time they had with their daughters, who defied the odds by surviving the birth and breathing on their own.

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome1": "Mr Robb's experience with depression highlights the importance of seeking professional help and finding effective treatment. He suffered for 43 years without proper diagnosis or medication, and resorted to various methods to cope with his condition, such as putting a pen in his mouth or sneezing deliberately. He said he felt a dramatic improvement after he started taking medication four years ago, and was able to resume his political career. His story shows that depression can be managed and overcome with the right support and intervention.\n\nHowever, Mr Robb's case is not representative of the general situation in Australia, where depression and suicide are still major public health issues. According to Beyond Blue, an Australian organisation that promotes mental health awareness, one in six Australians experience depression at some point in their lives, and eight people die by suicide every day. Many people do not seek help or face stigma and discrimination when they do. There is also a lack of adequate funding and resources for prevention and early intervention programs, as well as long waiting times and limited access to mental health services. Ms Burke argued that Australia needs to shift its focus from hospital beds to preventive measures, such as encouraging people to visit their doctors early, raising awareness of the signs and symptoms of depression, and providing more community-based support and education. She said that Australia should not wait for people to reach the bottom of a cliff before offering them help.",

'For the last four years I've had better days than any days for the 43 years before,' Mr Robb said.

Why are we waiting for everybody to end up at the bottom of a cliff in the ambulance going to the hospital?'",
      "Outcome3": "One of the panelists who responded to Mr Robb's story was Labor MP Anna Burke, who has a personal interest in mental health issues. Ms Burke lost her brother-in-law to suicide and has seen the impact of depression on her family and friends. She said that depression is an 'epidemic' in Australia, and that the current system is not doing enough to prevent it. She argued that Australians are too obsessed with hospital beds, which only cater to people who have reached a crisis point. She said that more resources should be allocated to early intervention and prevention strategies, such as awareness campaigns, counselling services, and support networks. 'We don't need them to wait 43 years like Andrew did,' Ms Burke said. 'We don't need them to wait 43 years like Andrew did. 'We need the prevention there at the beginning. We are obsessed with hospital beds in this country. Why are we waiting for everybody to end up at the bottom of a cliff in the ambulance going to the hospital?'",
      "Outcome4": "Mr Robb's unconventional methods of driving with a pen in his mouth and sneezing by looking at the sun were ways of stimulating his brain to release endorphins, which are natural chemicals that can improve mood and reduce pain. By mimicking the facial expression of smiling and triggering a reflexive response, Mr Robb was trying to fool his brain into thinking he was happier than he felt. These methods may have helped him cope with his depression by providing some temporary relief and distraction from his negative thoughts and feelings. However, they were not enough to address the underlying causes of his depression, which required medication and professional help.",
      "Outcome5": "Mr Robb's candid admission was welcomed by the audience and the panel, who praised him for raising awareness and reducing stigma around mental health issues. Mr Robb, who resigned from parliament in 2009 due to his depression, said he decided to speak out after realising that many people suffer in silence and feel ashamed of their condition. He said he hoped his story would encourage others to seek help and find the treatment that works for them.",
      "Outcome6": "Ms Burke praised Mr Robb for speaking candidly about his struggle with depression, and said his story could inspire others to seek help. 'Andrew's told a great journey, and I'm so glad he's come out the other side,' she said. 'But there are so many people in Australia who don't come out the other side.' She said the stigma around mental health issues still prevents many people from reaching out for support or treatment. 'We've got to get rid of that stigma, we've got to get people talking about it, and we've got to get people accessing the services they need,' she said."
