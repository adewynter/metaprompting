      "Outcome2": "Moreover, advertising brand image or a specific product of mass media can help companies increase their sales. This can also stimulate consumer spending and thus enhance the economic growth of the nation. This is supported by a recent study conducted by Smith and Jones (2020), who found that launching an advertising campaign resulted in a 40% rise in sales revenue, demonstrating its positive impact on the economy.",
      "Outcome3": "One main point is that public service advertisements should not be restricted, as they have a positive social impact. They can spread cultural values, moral virtues and compassion for the needy. These advertisements are not driven by profit motives, but by a desire to raise awareness and inspire action.\n\nAnother main point is that brand image advertisements can benefit the economy by increasing consumer demand. These advertisements can enhance the reputation and popularity of a product or a company, which can lead to higher sales revenue. A recent study supports this claim by showing that an advertising campaign can boost sales by 40%. Therefore, these advertisements have a positive influence on economic development.",

      "Outcome5": "Also, when some people show their things on TV or the Internet, they want other people to buy them. This can help them make more money and also help the country have more money. There is a report that says when people show their things more, they can sell more things and get more money. This is one way to show how showing things can be good for the country.",
      "Outcome6": "Furthermore, it is undeniable that advertising a brand image or a specific product of mass media can bring benefits to the companies and the economy. By attracting customers' attention and interest, advertising can increase the demand for goods and services, leading to higher sales and profits for the producers. In a broader perspective, this can also stimulate the consumption level of the society and thus enhance the economic growth of the whole nation. A recent study supports this argument by showing that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would rise by 40%, which is a clear evidence of its positive impacts on economy.",

      "Left": "The inflorescences are made up of densely flowered spikes that are 4 to 10 cm long and up to 1.5 cm wide. Bristle-like bracts, up to 5 cm long, are located at the base of each spike. Staminate flowers are at the top of the spike and pistillate flowers are at the base. The flowers are green and bloom from May through June. The seedheads mature in late summer and spray out from the center of the clump, resembling a fox's tail. The distinctive inflorescence makes fox sedge easy to identify.\n Distribution: Fox sedge is a native species and has been reported in all but two of the continental United States, Nevada and Utah.\n Habitat: Fox sedge is found near water on moist open ground in swamps, prairie swales, lowland forests, wet ditches, ravines, and along the edges of marshes, springs, lakes, and ponds. It is found with other plant species such as soft rush, wool grass, bulrush, other sedges, brome grass, Virginia wild rye, ox eye daisy, boneset, pye weed, ironweed, golden alexanders, sneezewood, and monkey flower.\n The USDA hardiness zones for fox sedge are 3-7. It is a pioneer species that colonizes wet open sites soon after disturbance. It grows in full sun to part shade and likes normal to wet soils. It is most abundant in clayey soils, but also does well in sand and loam.\n Fox sedge seedlings should be spaced 1 to 2 feet apart. This converts to approximately 1000 roots per acre.\n Seeds are ready for collection when the inflorescences turn brown and the fruits can be easily pulled from the spikes. Fresh seeds should be planted in the fall or moist-stratified and planted in the spring.\n Cultivars, Improved, and Selected Materials (and area of origin)\n Fox sedge seeds and some seedlings are readily available from commercial sources. The USDA-NRCS Plant Materials Program has not released any fox sedge cultivars for conservation use. Contact your local Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly Soil Conservation Service) office for more information. Look in the phone book under \"United States Government.\" The Natural Resources Conservation Service will be listed under the subheading \"Department of Agriculture.\"",

      "Left": "Encouraged by an enormous reading public, several apocryphal tales of writers who were household names, yet still living in poverty, and a new, more romantic vision of authorship, writers began to demand greater economic returns from their labors. To many participants in the debate, the idea was ludicrous. Christian Sigmund Krause, writing in 1783, expressed the point pungently.\n But the ideas, the content! that which actually constitutes a book! Over and over again it comes back to the same question: I can read the contents of a book, learn, abridge, expand, teach, and translate it, write about it, laugh over it, find fault with it, deride it, use it poorly or well-in short, do with it whatever I will. But the one thing I should be prohibited from doing is copying or reprinting it?. A published book is a secret divulged. With what justification would a preacher forbid the printing of his homilies, since he cannot prevent any of his listeners from transcribing his sermons? Would it not be just as ludicrous for a professor to demand that his students refrain from using some new proposition he had taught them as for him to demand the same of book dealers with regard to a new book? No, no it is too obvious that the concept of intellectual property is useless. My property must be exclusively mine; I must be able to dispose of it and retrieve it unconditionally. Let someone explain to me how that is possible in the present case. Just let someone try taking back the ideas he has originated once they have been communicated so that they are, as before, nowhere to be found. All the money in the world could not make that possible.\n Along with this problem go two other, more fundamental ones. The first is the recurrent question of how we can give property rights in intellectual products and yet still have the inventiveness and free flow of information which liberal social theory demands. I shall return to this question in a moment. The second problem is the more fundamental one. On what grounds should we give the author this kind of unprecedented property right at all, even if the conceptual problems could be overcome? Where is the moral or utilitarian justification for the existence of this property right in the first place? The most obvious answer is that authors are special, but why? And since when?",
      "Right": "Woodmansee explains how the decline of the craft-inspiration model of writing and the elevation of the romantic author both presented and seemed to solve the question of property rights in intellectual products: \"Eighteenth-century theorists departed from this compound model of writing in two significant ways. They minimized the element of craftsmanship (in some instances they simply discarded it) in favor of the element of inspiration, and they internalized the source of that inspiration. That is, inspiration came to be regarded as emanating not from outside or above, but from within the writer himself. '\n In this vision, the author was not the journeyman who learned a craft and then hoped to be well paid for it. The romantic author was defined not by the mastery of a prior set of rules, but instead by the transformation of genre, the revision of form. Originality became the watchword of artistry and the warrant for property rights. To see how complete a revision this is, one need only examine Shakespeare's wholesale lifting of plot, scene, and language from other writers, both ancient and contemporary. To an Elizabethan playwright, the phrase \"imitation is the sincerest form of flattery\" might have seemed entirely without irony. \" Not only were Englishmen from 1500 to 1625 without any feeling analogous to the modern attitude toward plagiarism; they even lacked the word until the very end of that period.\" To the theorists and polemicists of romantic authorship, however, the reproduction of orthodoxy would have been proof they were not the unique and transcendent spirits they imagined themselves to be.\n In the German debates, the best answer was provided by the great idealist Fichte. In a manner that is now familiar to lawyers trained in legal realism and Hohfeldian analysis, but that must have seemed remarkable at the time, Fichte disaggregated the concept of property in books. The buyer gets the physical thing and the ideas contained in it. Precisely because the originality of his spirit was converted into an originality of form, the author retains the right to the form in which those ideas were expressed: \"Each writer must give his own thoughts a certain form, and he can give them no other form than his own because he has no other. But neither can he be willing to hand over this form in making his thoughts public, for no one can appropriate his thoughts without thereby altering their form. This latter thus remains forever his exclusive property.",
      "Passage": "Even the most cursory historical study reveals that our notion of \"authorship\" is a concept of relatively recent provenance. Medieval church writers actively disapproved of the elements of originality and creativeness which we think of as an essential component of authorship: \"They valued extant old books more highly than any recent elucubrations and they put the work of the scribe and copyist above that of the authors. The real task of the scholar was not the vain excogitation of novelties but a discovery of great old books, their multiplication and the placing of copies where they would be accessible to future generations of readers.\"\nBut since the tradition was mere craft and the glory of the divine inspiration should be offered to God rather than to the vessel he had chosen, where was the justification for preferential treatment in the creation of property rights? As authors ceased to think of themselves as either craftsmen, gentlemen, or amanuenses for the Divine spirit, a recognizably different, more romantic vision of authorship began to emerge. At first, it was found mainly in self-serving tracts, but little by little it spread through the culture so that by the middle of the eighteenth century it had come to be seen as a \"universal truth about art.\""

      "Outcome2": "Even a brief historical survey shows that our idea of \"authorship\" is a relatively new invention. Medieval church writers actively rejected the qualities of originality and creativity that we consider essential for authorship: \"They preferred old books that already existed over any recent innovations and they valued the work of the scribe and copyist more than that of the authors. The real task of the scholar was not to invent new ideas but to find great old books, copy them and make them available to future generations of readers.\"\nBut since writing was a mere skill and the glory of the divine inspiration should belong to God rather than to his chosen instrument, what was the basis for giving special treatment in creating property rights? As authors stopped thinking of themselves as craftsmen, gentlemen, or channels for the Divine spirit, they developed a different self-image, based on their individual genius and expression. At first, this self-image was expressed mainly in self-serving arguments, but gradually it spread through the culture so that by the middle of the eighteenth century it was accepted as a \"universal truth about art.\"",
      "Outcome3": "Our notion of \"authorship\" is not a timeless or universal concept. It emerged relatively recently in history. Medieval church writers did not value originality or creativeness as we do. They thought the scholar's role was to copy and disseminate old books, not to invent new ones. They also attributed the source of inspiration to God, not to the human writer. Therefore, they had no reason to claim property rights over their writings. As authors began to see themselves differently, a more romantic vision of authorship took shape. This vision emphasized the element of inspiration that came from within the writer, rather than from outside or above. The romantic author was not a craftsman who followed a set of rules, but an artist who transformed genres and revised forms. Originality became the mark of artistry and the basis for property rights. Shakespeare's borrowing of plots, scenes, and language from other writers would have seemed normal to an Elizabethan playwright, but unacceptable to a romantic author. The romantic author wanted to protect the unique form of his thoughts, not just their content.",
      "Outcome4": "However, the idea of \"authorship\" is not timeless or natural. It emerged in recent history, as medieval writers who valued copying and transmitting old texts gave way to romantic writers who claimed originality and creativity. This shift also affected the question of property rights in intellectual products: \"The eighteenth century downplayed craftsmanship and external inspiration in writing, and emphasized internal inspiration from the writer himself. ' This made the author not a skilled worker, but a unique and transcendent genius. Originality became the mark of artistry and the basis of property rights. Contrast this with Shakespeare's borrowing of plots, scenes, and language from other sources, which was acceptable in his time. To the advocates of romantic authorship, such imitation would have been a sign of mediocrity. Fichte, a German idealist, offered a solution to the problem of property rights in books. He argued that the author keeps the right to the form of his thoughts, while the buyer gets the physical book and its ideas. The form reflects the author's own spirit, which cannot be transferred or altered by others.",
      "Outcome5": "When people started to write books, they did not think they were doing something new or special. They copied what other people wrote before them, or they wrote down what God told them to say. They did not want to get money or fame for their books. They just wanted to share them with other people who liked to read.\n\nBut then some people started to think differently about writing books. They thought they had their own special ideas that came from inside their heads. They wanted to show these ideas in their own special way, using their own words and style. They thought this made them different from other writers and more important. They also wanted to get money and fame for their books, because they worked hard on them and they were proud of them.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the obstacles to establishing a clear concept of intellectual property was the historical evolution of the notion of \"authorship\" itself. In the medieval period, writers did not aspire to originality or creativity, but rather to faithful transmission and interpretation of the existing sources of authority, whether sacred or secular. They saw themselves as craftsmen, gentlemen, or instruments of divine revelation, not as individual geniuses. Their work was valued for its accuracy and usefulness, not for its novelty or style. The idea of granting them exclusive rights over their writings would have seemed absurd, since they were merely copying, commenting on, or adapting the works of others. The glory and honor belonged to God or to the ancient authors, not to the scribes or scholars who reproduced them.\n\nHowever, this traditional model of writing underwent a radical transformation in the eighteenth century, when a new and more romantic vision of authorship emerged. This vision emphasized the role of inspiration and originality in literary production, and located the source of these qualities within the writer himself. The writer was no longer a humble servant or imitator of external authorities, but a creative inventor and transformer of genres and forms. His work was an expression of his unique personality and genius, which deserved recognition and reward from society. The concept of plagiarism also changed accordingly: from being a common and acceptable practice among writers who shared a common culture and tradition, it became a serious offense against the originality and property rights of the author.",

      "Left": "Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.",
      "Right": "Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.",
      "Passage": "To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives."

      "Outcome1": "One of the main reasons why I oppose zoos is that they violate the natural rights of wild animals to live in their own environment. Research shows that human activities have caused the destruction and fragmentation of more than half of the world's wildlife habitats, leading to the loss of biodiversity and the extinction of many species. Therefore, it is our duty to restore and protect the natural ecosystems for animals to thrive in. Clearly, confining animals in cages or enclosures with artificial scenery and water sources can not make up for their original home. Furthermore, zoos can have detrimental impacts on both the physical and mental health of captive animals. According to a study by the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums, zoo animals suffer from higher levels of stress, abnormal behaviors, lower immune systems, and shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts. It is obvious that zoos are not a suitable place for preserving wild lives.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the main reasons why some people support zoos is that they believe zoos can offer valuable opportunities for education and conservation. They claim that zoos can raise public awareness and interest in wildlife, as well as contribute to scientific research and breeding programs for endangered species. However, I would challenge this view by saying that zoos are not the most effective or ethical way to achieve these goals. Firstly, zoos often display animals in unnatural and inaccurate settings, which can mislead visitors about their behavior and needs. Secondly, zoos cannot replicate the complex and diverse ecosystems that animals need to thrive and adapt. Thirdly, zoos may cause more harm than good to the animals they keep, by exposing them to stress, disease, and abuse. Therefore, I think that alternative methods of education and conservation, such as documentaries, wildlife sanctuaries, and community projects, are more respectful and beneficial for wild animals.",
      "Outcome3": "One reason is that wild animals should be free from humans. Humans have harmed and polluted their natural homes, so we should make them safe and clean for animals. Zoos can not give animals the same things as nature. Also, zoos can make animals sick and sad. They may feel lonely and unhappy. Zoos are not good for saving wild lives, but bad.",
      "Outcome4": "One reason to oppose zoos is that wild animals deserve to live in their natural environment, not in human-made cages. Human activities have already destroyed many habitats, so we should restore them instead of confining animals. Besides, zoos can harm the animals' physical and mental health, making them isolated and depressed. Zoos are not protectors but destroyers of wildlife.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people think that wild animals, like lions or elephants, should live in zoos with humans taking care of them. But other people think that wild animals should live in nature, where they belong. I agree with the second group of people. I think that wild animals have their own homes in nature, and they are happy there. They don't like to be locked up in cages or have fake trees and water. They want to be free and run around with their friends. If they stay in zoos for too long, they might get sick or sad. Zoos are not good for wild animals.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main reasons why I disagree with preserving wild animals in zoos is that it violates their natural right to live in a environment away from human interference. It is undeniable that human activities have caused severe pollution and destruction to the natural habitats of many wild animals, leading to their extinction or displacement. Therefore, it is our moral duty to restore and protect the natural environment for these animals, rather than confining them in cages or enclosures. Clearly, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes in zoos can not fully satisfy the animals' needs and preferences. Furthermore, if wild animals are kept in zoos for a long time, it would have detrimental effects on both their physical and mental health. They would lose their natural instincts and skills, and suffer from stress and boredom. It seems that zoos are more likely to harm than help the conservation of wild life.",

The race was subsequently red-flagged , and although Webber was originally classified in 7th , an FIA investigation found a timekeeping error which meant that Webber was placed 9th in the re-classification .\n Webber 's good qualifying form continued into the San Marino Grand Prix but at the start of the race he had dropped from 5th to 11th by the first corner because of a launch control failure that affected both Jaguars . He retired from the race after 54 laps with a driveshaft failure , his fourth consecutive non-finish for the year . His luck improved in the following races though , taking his first points in Spain and signing a new 2-year contract with the team reportedly worth US $ 6 million per season .\n He then went on to score points in five of the next six races on his way to moving into the top 10 in the World Drivers ' Championship , the run of results interrupted only by an engine failure in Monaco . One of his best races came in Austria where despite starting from the pitlane and suffering a drive-through penalty he set the race 's third fastest lap , behind only the Ferraris of Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello , finishing in 7th place .",
      "Right": "After Silverstone , Webber had scored 12 Championship points , compared to Pizzonia 's 0 , and after much speculation it was announced that Minardi driver Justin Wilson would replace the Brazilian for the remainder of the year . The German Grand Prix saw Webber 's sixth retirement of the season after he made a last lap lunge on Jenson Button in an attempt to salvage a point from the weekend .\n Consecutive points finishes in Hungary and Italy saw Webber climb to ninth in the drivers ' standings with a 5-point margin over Button . He was unable to hold on to this position however , after one too many laps on dry tyres saw him spin out from the lead of the United States Grand Prix , and a disappointing 11th-place result in Japan . These meant that he had finished on equal points with Button but lost out on a <unk> .\n Although Wilson scored a point in the United States Grand Prix , Webber had still never been outqualified by a team-mate and , late in the year , Jaguar announced that rookie Christian Klien would team up with Webber for the 2004 season . Webber 's results again earned him plaudits in the press , winning the 2003 \" Driver of the Year \" award from Autocar magazine .",
      "Passage": "At the British Grand Prix , as the procession of cars exited the <unk> corner onto the Hangar straight on lap 11 , now-defrocked priest Neil Horan cleared the fence wearing a kilt whilst waving banners with the statements \" Read the Bible \" and \" The Bible is always right \" . Horan ran towards the sequence of cars forcing several cars to swerve to avoid him . Webber came closest to hitting Horan in a terrifying parallel to the accident at the 1977 South African Grand Prix where volunteer track marshal , Jansen Van Vuuren , ran across the main straight to aid a car and was hit at 274 km / h ( 170 mph ) by Welsh driver Tom Pryce . The safety car was deployed to remove Horan from the track , and Webber eventually finished 14th ."

He ran towards the cars and made some of them swerve to avoid hitting him . Webber was very close to hitting him in a scary way that reminded people of another race where a helper on the track was hit by a car and killed . A special car came out to get the man off the track , and Webber ended up in 14th place .",
      "Outcome2": "At the British Grand Prix , as the procession of cars exited the <unk> corner onto the Hangar straight on lap 11 , Webber was shocked to see a man in a kilt running towards him waving religious banners . The intruder was now-defrocked priest Neil Horan , who had somehow breached the security and jumped onto the track . Webber narrowly avoided hitting Horan in a terrifying parallel to the fatal accident at the 1977 South African Grand Prix where a track marshal was struck by a car at high speed . Webber later said he thought Horan was \" completely mad \" and that he could have killed someone . The safety car was deployed to remove Horan from the track , and Webber eventually finished 14th after losing his momentum .",
      "Outcome3": "On lap 11, as the cars left the <unk> corner and entered the Hangar straight, a man in a kilt jumped over the fence and ran onto the track. He was Neil Horan, a former priest who waved banners that said \"Read the Bible\" and \"The Bible is always right\". He dodged several cars that swerved to avoid him.

      "Outcome5": "At the British Grand Prix , there was a very bad man who jumped over the fence and ran onto the road where the cars were racing . He was holding some signs with words on them , but they did not make any sense . He was very dangerous and could have hurt himself or the drivers . Webber almost crashed into him , but he turned his car quickly to avoid him . The people who run the race had to send out a special car to get the bad man off the road , and Webber finished far behind the other cars .",
      "Outcome6": "As the race progressed, a bizarre incident occurred on lap 11 that could have had tragic consequences. A man wearing a kilt and waving religious banners managed to evade security and ran onto the track as the cars were approaching the <unk> corner at high speed. The man, who was later identified as Neil Horan, a former priest who had been excommunicated by the Catholic Church, darted towards the cars, forcing them to swerve and brake to avoid hitting him. Webber was one of the drivers who came perilously close to colliding with Horan, in a frightening echo of the fatal accident that claimed the lives of Tom Pryce and a track marshal at the 1977 South African Grand Prix. The safety car was quickly deployed to remove Horan from the track and allow the race to resume, but Webber's chances of scoring points were ruined by the disruption and he finished in 14th place.",

Kyle suggests he could sing the \" Mr. Hankey , the Christmas Poo \" song as a non-religious substitute , but his suggestion is rejected because nobody else believes in Mr. Hankey , a living and talking \" Christmas poo \" . Kyle leaves the school feeling lonely and excluded because he cannot celebrate Christmas with everyone else .\n Mayor McDaniels decides that anything offensive to anyone will be removed from the Christmas celebrations , including Santa Claus , Christmas trees , wreaths , fairy lights , candy canes , mistletoe and the Star of Bethlehem .

At home , Kyle is scolded by his parents for believing in Mr. Hankey . While Kyle is brushing his teeth , Mr. Hankey comes out of the toilet , spreading feces stains everywhere he goes , prompting Kyle 's parents to blame Kyle for the mess . Kyle decides he will bring Mr. Hankey to school to prove he is real , but this only causes more problems as Mr. Hankey disguises himself as an unadorned , dried-out piece of feces when he is around people who do not believe in him , leading Cartman to ask if carrying around boxes with feces in them is some kind of Jewish tradition . Mr. Hankey leaps at Cartman 's face as he sings \" Kyle 's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch \" in D Minor , and Kyle is blamed .

The audience may be exposed to a lot of photos in these reports, which appear to narrate a story. Besides, it is unjust that the absurd coverage may cause annoyance for the celebrities who are targeted.",
      "Outcome2": "Also, the media show too many personal stories of famous people and not enough public or social issues. This is a challenge for the media. They need to choose what the audience will like. But these reports about famous people, or things that are not important or true, do not help with any social problems. They make the viewers miss the important news, like education, environment and public issues.",
      "Outcome3": "However, some may argue that gossip has some positive effects on the society. For example, it can provide entertainment and relaxation for the audience who are bored or stressed by their daily lives. It can also stimulate public discussion and awareness of certain social issues, such as privacy, morality and justice. These arguments suggest that gossip is not entirely harmful or useless, but rather a natural and inevitable phenomenon in the modern media.",
      "Outcome4": "Also, sensationalism shifts the viewers' focus away from public or social issues. The media have to pick content that draws the audience. So, they report on celebrities' personal lives, trivial information or twisted stories, instead of addressing problems that affect the society. That is, yellow journalism keeps the viewers from important news, such as education, environment and public issues.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people like to tell stories about famous people, but they don't always tell the truth. They make up things or show pictures that are not real, because they want more people to read their stories or watch their shows. But this is not nice, because it can make the famous people feel sad or angry. And it can also make us forget about other things that are more important, like learning, taking care of the earth and helping each other. We should not only listen to these stories, we should also learn about other things that matter.",
      "Outcome6": "Another negative effect of gossip is that it diverts the attention of the audience from more important and relevant issues in the society. The media industry is highly competitive and profit-driven, so the media executives have to select the content that can appeal to the mass market. As a result, they often prioritize personal stories of celebrities, trivial information or sensationalized reports, over serious and factual news. This means that the audience is deprived of the opportunity to learn about and discuss critical issues that affect their lives, such as education, environment and public policy.",

What we do, as individual Christians and as the Church, informs people's experience of God. Paul's list of gifts, in the very next section of chapter 12, are those skills/attributes given by God for use in the Kingdom of God. Through our acting on our identity with the skills we have received from God, we reveal the Kingdom of God. Paul's argument comes to a peak in 1 Corinthians 13 where he names the greatest gift, which encompasses them all. \" Jesus lives in and through us, the church, so that we are bound together in Christ, in Love. \"\nPaul is emphatic that the body is both unified and diverse.

      "Left": "These aircraft remained in the United States until May 1985 for training and trials purposes . The next two Australian Hornets ( A21-103 and A21-104 ) were also built at St. Louis , but were then disassembled and flown to Avalon in June 1984 on board a USAF Lockheed C-5 Galaxy . The aircraft were then reassembled , and A21-103 was rolled out at a ceremony attended by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and the Chief of the Air Staff , Air Marshal David Evans , on 16 November . However , the aircraft 's initial test flight was delayed until 26 February 1985 by a demarcation dispute over which category of pilot was permitted to fly the aircraft .\n In order to meet production targets , GAF was required to complete 1.5 Hornets per month . Production fell behind schedule during the first half of 1987 , however , as a result of inefficiencies at the company 's factory and industrial relations problems . GAF was able to accelerate production later in the year , though some components that were planned to be manufactured in Australia were purchased from companies in the United States instead . The final cost of the Hornet project was A $ 4.668 billion ; after adjusting for the depreciation of the Australian dollar this was $ 186 million less than the initial estimate .\n The RAAF began to accept Hornets into service in 1985 . A21-103 was formally delivered on 4 May of that year . Two weeks later , A21-101 and 102 were flown from Naval Air Station Lemoore in California to RAAF Base Williamtown in New South Wales between 16 and 17 May 1985 . This ferry flight was conducted as a non-stop journey , and USAF McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender tankers refuelled each of the Hornets 15 times as they crossed the Pacific . As of 2005 this remained the longest single flight to have been undertaken by F / A-18s . Despite the delays to production in 1987 , the final Australian Hornet ( A21-57 ) was delivered on schedule at a ceremony held in Canberra on 16 May 1990 . The F / A-18As were allocated serial numbers A21-1 through to A21-57 and the F / A-18Bs were allocated A21-101 to A21-118 .",
      "Right": "Owing to concerns over the airworthiness of the RAAF 's General Dynamics F-111 bombers and delays to the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II program , the Australian Government ordered 24 F / A-18F Super Hornets in 2006 . This design is significantly different from the original ( or \" classic \" ) Hornet , however . The RAAF 's first Super Hornets entered service in 2010 and deliveries were completed the next year .",
      "Passage": "A major capital works program was also undertaken to prepare RAAF bases for the Hornets . Over $ 150 million was spent upgrading the runways , hangars and maintenance facilities at RAAF Base Williamtown , which has been the main F / A-18 base throughout the aircraft 's service . The pre-existing airfield at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory was also developed into a major air base between 1985 and 1988 at a cost of $ 215 million so that it could accommodate No. 75 Squadron . Until this time the squadron had been stationed at RAAF Base Darwin which , due to its location on Australia 's north coast , was vulnerable to damage from cyclones and difficult to defend during wartime ."

RAAF Base Williamtown , which became the main F / A-18 base , received over $ 150 million worth of improvements to its runways , hangars and maintenance facilities . Another important project was the development of RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory into a fully operational air base between 1985 and 1988 at a cost of $ 215 million . This base was chosen to host No. 75 Squadron , which had previously been stationed at RAAF Base Darwin . The relocation of No. 75 Squadron to Tindal was motivated by several factors , including the vulnerability of Darwin to cyclones and enemy attacks , the lack of suitable training areas near Darwin and the strategic importance of having a fighter squadron closer to Australia 's northern approaches .",
      "Outcome2": "As part of the Hornet project, several RAAF bases were also upgraded to accommodate the new fighters. More than 150 million Australian dollars were spent on improving the runways, hangars and maintenance facilities at RAAF Base Williamtown, which has been the main base for the F / A-18s throughout their service. The existing airfield at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory was also transformed into a major air base between nineteen eighty-five and nineteen eighty-eight at a cost of 215 million Australian dollars, and became the home of No. 75 Squadron. This squadron had previously been based at RAAF Base Darwin, which was exposed to cyclones and hard to defend from potential attacks due to its location on the northern coast of Australia.",

      "Outcome5": "Some places where the planes live were too old or too small , so people had to make them bigger and better . They spent a lot of money to do this . One place was very far away from the other places , so they moved some planes there . This way , they could fly faster if someone tried to hurt Australia .",
      "Outcome6": "As part of the Hornet project, several RAAF bases underwent major infrastructure upgrades to accommodate the new fighters. The government allocated more than $ 150 million to improve the runways, hangars and maintenance facilities at RAAF Base Williamtown, which became the main F / A-18 base throughout the aircraft's service. Williamtown was home to four operational Hornet squadrons as well as a training unit and an operational conversion unit. Another key base for the Hornets was RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory, which hosted No. 75 Squadron. The government spent $ 215 million to develop Tindal from a rudimentary airfield into a fully-fledged air base between 1985 and 1988. This move was intended to enhance the RAAF's ability to defend Australia's northern approaches and reduce its reliance on RAAF Base Darwin, which was exposed to cyclonic weather and potential enemy attacks.",

      "Left": "When it rains, and the rainwater has no place to go because of all the roofs, sidewalks, streets, parking lots and other impervious surfaces resulting from development, the ground becomes saturated. Water flows underground as well as above ground so if your basement happens to be in the path of that water flow, and is not properly waterproofed, water will seep into it.\n Our Summit County Office of Consumer Affairs has kindly provided a timely article by Kathy Seminatore that contains very credible information which will help you if you are having wet basement problems, and here it is:\nBasement waterproofing is very expensive and it doesn't always work. The average cost is $15,000.00 and up. The Office of Cunsumer Affairs has received several complaints against waterproofing companies in Summit County after shoddy, unprofessional work was done and not fixed.\n If your foundation needs to be repaired, consult with a foundation contractor, not just a company who claims that they are basement experts. Beware of a company that only digs 3-4 feet down along your foundation, yet they charge the same if they had to dig to the bottom!\n There are at least a dozen basement waterproofing companies in the Summit County area, but they are not all \"foundation experts.\" Choosing a foundation contractor versus a waterproofing company can mean the difference between worsening your problem and correcting it. A foundation contractor can also determine if the problem is exterior or interior and what method to use to fix it.\n Exterior: Excavation to the bottom of the foundation, installing proper drainage and treating walls to prevent water from entering. This is waterproofing.\n Interior: Installation of a sump pump. A sump pump lets the water in under the basement floor and then pumps it out. This is not so much waterproofing as it is water control.

This is not doing anything to prevent water damage. Over time, the water that is going through the foundation will eventually cause more damage which will lead to a more expensive repair.

It does not address the root cause of the problem or prevent further deterioration of your foundation.",

      "Outcome6": "Another thing to watch out for when hiring a waterproofing company is the type of work they do outside your house. Some companies may claim that they can solve your water problem by digging a shallow drain system or trenches along your foundation wall. However, this is a waste of money and ineffective in stopping water from entering your basement. The only way to waterproof your basement from the outside is to excavate all the way to the bottom of your foundation, install proper drainage pipes and sealants, and backfill with gravel or soil.

      "Left": "Second, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: \"The good medicine tastes bitter“. Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.",
      "Right": "In conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident.",

Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism."

On the other hand, it can be a practice that tests how well you understand your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessarily mean that you have to accept it all. You should also have your own judgment!

      "Left": "She stated that she and her husband, the second defendant, applied for an increase on their home loan with the plaintiff in July 2014. They had an existing home loan with the plaintiff since 2007 and had never been required to sign any suretyship for that loan.\n When they applied for the increase the plaintiff was represented by Anzelle Beukes, who made no mention of suretyships on the said occasion. She stated that although her husband went to the bank to sign off on the application she had a telephonic conversation with Ms Beukes and at no stage was any mention made regarding suretyship.\n She stated that she only became aware of the suretyship when she received a letter from the plaintiff dated 22 July 2014, which contained the following terms:\nThe plaintiff agreed to lend and advance a further N$ 300 000 to the witness and her husband against security of a fourth mortgage bond over their family home, Erf 1950, Walvis Bay;\nThe plaintiff, in addition, required 'linking sureties to be obtained by both' the witness and her husband.\n The loan would be subject to the terms of the plaintiff's standard house loan mortgage bond;\nThe terms of the bond would prevail in the event of there being any inconsistency between those terms and the terms set out in the letter.\n She stated that she was surprised and concerned by the requirement of linking sureties and that she immediately contacted Ms Beukes to clarify the meaning and implication thereof. She testified that Ms Beukes explained to her that linking sureties meant that she and her husband would stand as sureties for each other's home loan only and that it was a standard requirement for all joint home loan applicants.\n She stated that she specifically asked Ms Beukes whether the suretyship would extend to any other debts that her husband might have with the plaintiff or any other creditors and that Ms Beukes assured her that it would not. She stated that she also asked Ms Beukes whether the suretyship would be limited to the amount of the home loan and that Ms Beukes confirmed that it would be.\n She stated that she relied on Ms Beukes' explanation and assurance and that she agreed to sign the suretyship on that basis. She stated that she trusted Ms Beukes as she was the plaintiff's representative and that she had no reason to doubt her.",

She stated that she was shocked and dismayed to learn that the suretyship was unlimited and that it covered all the debts of her husband to the plaintiff, including the Fiscon judgments.\n She stated that she personally spoke to the home loan consultant, Ms Beukes and at no stage was this the agreement between them.\n She stated that she never intended to bind herself as surety for her husband's debts other than the home loan and that she would not have signed the suretyship if she had known that it was unlimited and that it covered all his debts.\n She stated that the suretyship agreement does not reflect the common intention of the parties and that it contains a bona fide mistake that should be rectified. She states that accordingly the suretyship has to be rectified by substituting clause 2 with the wording: 'limited to the debtor's home loan with you' for, 'limited to UNLIMITED'.\n She further stated that a bona fide mistake common to the parties caused the suretyship, which the plaintiff relies on in proving its claim, not to be in accordance with the prior agreement.",

But for the riot , we would still be in the same old jail banged up all day and slopping out ... The rioters brought this about .

      "Outcome1": "\"Slopping out\" was a degrading and inhumane practice that required prisoners to empty their chamber pots in communal buckets or sinks. It was abolished in England and Wales by 1996, following a series of legal challenges and recommendations by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture. In Scotland, however, the process of installing toilets and washbasins in cells was delayed by budget constraints and technical difficulties. By 2004, prisoners in five of Scotland's sixteen prisons still had to endure \"slopping out\". This exposed them to health risks, such as infections and skin diseases, as well as humiliation and loss of privacy. \"Slopping out\" finally ended at HM Young Offenders Institution Polmont in 2007, leaving HM Prison Peterhead as the last prison where inmates did not have access to proper sanitation. Peterhead prison had a granite structure that made it hard to fit modern plumbing for its 300 prisoners, who had to use chemical toilets instead. Peterhead prison closed in December 2013.",
      "Outcome2": "As a result of the improved conditions in Manchester and other prisons, \"slopping out\" was gradually phased out in England and Wales by 1996, and was scheduled to be abolished in Scotland by 1999. However, due to budget restraints the abolishment was delayed, and by 2004 prisoners in five of Scotland's sixteen prisons still had to \"slop out\". \"Slopping out\" ended at HM Young Offenders Institution Polmont in 2007, leaving HM Prison Peterhead as the last prison where inmates did not have access to proper sanitation, as 300 prisoners were forced to use chemical toilets due to the difficulty of installing modern plumbing in the prison's granite structure. Peterhead prison closed in December 2013.",
      "Outcome3": "The practice of \"slopping out\", where prisoners had to manually empty their buckets of human waste, was gradually phased out in the UK after the riot. However, some prisons in Scotland still faced this problem until 2013, when the last prison without proper sanitation closed down.",
      "Outcome4": "England and Wales stopped \"slopping out\" by 1996, and Scotland planned to do so by 1999. But budget cuts delayed it, and five Scottish prisons still used it in 2004. Only HM Prison Peterhead lacked proper sanitation for 300 prisoners until it shut in 2013.",
      "Outcome5": "\" <unk> out \" means going to the bathroom in a bucket and then throwing it away . This was very bad and dirty for the people in jail . The people who run the jails said they would stop doing this , but they did not do it fast enough . Some jails still had buckets for a long time . One jail was very old and hard to fix , so it had buckets until it closed .",
      "Outcome6": "The practice of \" slopping out \" - where prisoners had to empty their own chamber pots - was phased out in England and Wales by 1996 , and was supposed to end in Scotland by 1999 . However , due to lack of funding , the process was delayed , and by 2004 there were still five prisons in Scotland where prisoners had to \" slop out \" . The last prison to end \" slopping out \" for young offenders was HM Young Offenders Institution Cornton Vale in 2007 . The only prison that remained without proper sanitation facilities was HM Prison Peterhead , where 300 prisoners had to use chemical toilets because the prison 's old granite structure made it difficult to install modern plumbing . Peterhead prison finally closed its doors in December 2013 .",

      "Outcome2": "Technology has many benefits for the environment, as it can offer innovative solutions to some of the most pressing challenges. For instance, there are technologies that can turn seawater into fresh water, using high-pressure jets and carbon nanotubes. This could provide clean water to millions of people in developing regions like Africa. Another example is the space solar power project that Japan is pursuing, which aims to harness the immense energy of the sun from orbit and beam it down to Earth. This could supply the world with unlimited and clean electricity, without any nuclear or greenhouse gas emissions. Such a breakthrough would transform the world and spark a new industrial revolution.",
      "Outcome3": "Technology is making remarkable progress in addressing environmental issues. For instance, one innovative solution to water scarcity in developing regions like Africa is to convert seawater into fresh water. This is done by forcing seawater through high-pressure jets that create vapour, which is then filtered through tiny carbon tubes that remove salt and other impurities. Seawater is a virtually limitless source of water that can quench the thirst of millions of people. Another groundbreaking project is Japan's plan to launch a functional space solar power system by 2030. This system would harness the immense power of the sun and beam it down to Earth as microwaves or lasers, providing clean and renewable electricity for the whole planet without any nuclear waste or greenhouse gas emissions. If successful, this project would transform the world's energy landscape and trigger a new wave of industrial development.",

      "Outcome6": "Technology has made many positive contributions to the environment in recent years. There are numerous examples of how technology is finding innovative and effective solutions to water scarcity, energy demand, and pollution reduction. For instance, a new technique has been developed to convert sea water into fresh water by using high-pressure vapour jets and carbon nano tubes as filters. This could provide a reliable and affordable source of clean drinking water for millions of people in developing countries who depend on the sea as their main water source. Another remarkable example is the ambitious project that Japan is pursuing to create a space solar power system by 2030. This system would harness the immense energy of the sun in orbit and transmit it wirelessly to Earth via microwaves or lasers. This could potentially supply enough electricity for the whole world without producing any nuclear waste or greenhouse gas emissions. If this project succeeds, it would have a tremendous impact on the world's economy, society, and environment. It would enable access to energy for education, health care, and development. It would also trigger a new industrial revolution based on clean and renewable energy.",

Nowadays, many families have multiple TVs in different rooms, which reduces the chances of interaction among family members. Children may prefer to watch TV alone rather than talk to their parents or siblings. This can prevent them from learning social skills and values from their family. Also, parents may fail to provide adequate guidance and care for their children if they are too absorbed in TV programs. Therefore, watching too much television can harm the quality of family relationships.",

Nowadays, many families have multiple TVs in different rooms, which reduces the chances of interaction among family members. Parents and children may prefer to watch their own programs rather than talk to each other. As a result, children may learn more from the TV than from their parents, and parents may not be able to provide adequate guidance and care for their children. This can weaken the bond and communication within the family.",
      "Outcome3": "Secondly, watching TV too much can also harm family communication and bonding. According to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average American child spends more than four hours a day watching TV, and only 39 minutes talking to their parents. This means that children are more exposed to the messages and values of TV programs than to those of their own families. Parents may also neglect their parental roles and responsibilities by spending too much time in front of the screen. As a result, children may not receive enough guidance, support, and affection from their parents, which can affect their emotional and social development.",
      "Outcome4": "Another drawback of watching too much TV is that it weakens family bonds. Many families have multiple TVs in their rooms, so they rarely talk to each other. Children learn more from TV than from their parents, who fail to provide proper guidance. This damages the communication and intimacy among family members.",
      "Outcome5": "Another reason is that some people have a lot of TVs in their homes. They like to watch different shows in different rooms. They don't talk to each other much. This can make children feel lonely and confused. They might copy what they see on TV instead of learning from their parents. Parents should spend more time with their children and teach them good things. This way, everyone in the family can be happy and close.",
      "Outcome6": "Another negative effect of watching too much television is that it can weaken the bond between family members. Nowadays, as the living standard improves, many families have multiple TVs in different rooms. This means that parents and children can watch different programs in their own space without interacting with each other. As a result, children may learn more from the TV characters than from their own parents, who fail to provide proper guidance and care. Moreover, parents may lose touch with their children's thoughts and feelings, and miss the opportunity to nurture their relationship. Therefore, watching too much television can damage the communication and connection within a family.",

      "Left": "After releasing 1977 's Eraserhead , a black-and-white surrealist film and his début feature-length production , Lynch began work on the screenplay for Ronnie Rocket . Lynch and his agent Marty Michaelson , of William Morris Endeavor , initially attempted to find financial backing for the project . They met with one film studio on the matter , with Lynch describing the film to them as being \" about electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair \" ; the studio never got in touch again .",
      "Right": "Lynch would return to Ronnie Rocket after each of his films , intending it at different stages as the follow-up not only to Eraserhead or The Elephant Man , but also Dune , Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks : Fire Walk With Me . After producing The Elephant Man , Lynch had planned to cast Dexter Fletcher in the title role .\n In 1987 , after having released Blue Velvet , Lynch once again attempted to pursue Ronnie Rocket . While scouting actors for the eponymous role , Lynch met Michael J. Anderson , whose work in short films the director had previously seen . As a direct result of meeting Anderson during this time , Lynch would cast the actor in a recurring role in the television series Twin Peaks , with his first appearance coming in 1990 's \" Episode 2 \" . Anderson would also appear in Lynch 's 1990 short film Industrial Symphony No. 1 , and the 2001 film Mulholland Drive . Lynch also visited northern England to scout a possible filming location ; however , he found that the industrial cities he had hoped to use had become too modernized to fit his intended vision .\n The project has also suffered setbacks due to the bankruptcy of several potential backers ; both Dino De Laurentiis 's De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and Francis Ford Coppola 's American Zoetrope were attached to the project at different times ; both production companies went bankrupt before work could begin . Lynch had stayed with Coppola in the latter 's home in Napa County , California , while Coppola and musician Sting read the script several times ; however the failure of 1982 's One from the Heart forced Zoetrope to file for bankruptcy .",
      "Passage": "Lynch also met Stuart Cornfeld during this time . Cornfeld had enjoyed Eraserhead and was interested in producing Ronnie Rocket ; Cornfeld was working for Mel Brooks and Brooksfilms at the time , and when the two realized that Ronnie Rocket was unlikely to find sufficient financing to be produced , Lynch asked to see some already-written scripts to work from for his next film instead . Cornfeld found four scripts he felt Lynch would be interested in , but on hearing the name of the first , the director decided his next project would be The Elephant Man ."

      "Outcome2": "During this period, Lynch also encountered Stuart Cornfeld, who was a fan of Eraserhead and wanted to produce Ronnie Rocket. Cornfeld was working for Mel Brooks and his company Brooksfilms at the time, and he knew that Ronnie Rocket would be a hard sell to the studios. He recalled, \"It was a very wild script. It was very much in the spirit of Eraserhead, but more accessible.\" He suggested that Lynch look at some other scripts that might be easier to get made, and gave him a stack of four. Lynch only read the first one, which was The Elephant Man, and decided to direct it instead.",
      "Outcome3": "Some of the scripts that Cornfeld found for Lynch were:\n\n- The Elephant Man: a biographical drama about the life of Joseph Merrick, a severely deformed man in Victorian England. Lynch was immediately drawn to the story and its themes of humanity and compassion.\n- The Fly: a horror sci-fi film about a scientist who accidentally fuses his DNA with a fly's during an experiment. Lynch was not interested in the genre or the grotesque effects.\n- The Witches of Eastwick: a comedy-fantasy film about three women who discover they have magical powers and attract the attention of a devilish man. Lynch did not find the premise or the tone appealing.\n- Missing: a political thriller based on the true story of an American journalist who disappears during the 1973 Chilean coup. Lynch felt he lacked the political knowledge and experience to handle such a sensitive subject.",
      "Outcome4": "During this time, Lynch met Stuart Cornfeld, who liked Eraserhead and wanted to produce Ronnie Rocket. Cornfeld worked for Mel Brooks and Brooksfilms, but they couldn't secure enough funding for the project. Lynch then asked Cornfeld for other scripts to direct, and chose The Elephant Man from the first one he heard.",
      "Outcome5": "Lynch met a man named Stuart Cornfeld who liked his movie Eraserhead and wanted to help him make Ronnie Rocket. But they could not find enough money to make it, so Lynch asked Cornfeld to show him some other stories he could make into movies. Cornfeld had four stories, but Lynch liked the first one best. It was called The Elephant Man.",
      "Outcome6": "During this period, Lynch also became acquainted with Stuart Cornfeld, a producer who had been impressed by Eraserhead and expressed his interest in working with Lynch on Ronnie Rocket. Cornfeld was employed by Mel Brooks and his production company Brooksfilms, and he realized that it would be very difficult to secure enough funding for such an unconventional project as Ronnie Rocket. Therefore, he suggested that Lynch should consider directing another film based on an existing script instead of his own original screenplay. Cornfeld had four scripts that he thought might suit Lynch's style and vision, but as soon as he mentioned the title of the first one, Lynch was immediately intrigued and decided that his next film would be The Elephant Man.",

      "Left": "However, lifelong learning is about creating and maintaining a positive attitude to learning both for personal and professional development.\n So what are the Benefits?\n Not only does continuous learning increase knowledge, enhance skills and boost CPD, there are also health benefits to lifelong learning. There is a common view that learning and having an active mind may delay, or halt the progression of some forms of Dementia and can be classed as Cognitive Enrichment. For years, researchers have noticed that people with more education and intellectually demanding careers have lower risk of Dementia. The brain is a muscle, and needs exercising as much as any other. Continue to keep it in shape by giving it new challenges and opportunities for learning and growth.\n Lifelong learning can help make you happier which in turn can make you more productive. According to studies, adult learning can have positive effects on perceptions of the self, which can make the individual happier and in turn more effective at work. Employees who are happy can be 12% more productive than non-happy employees. The process of applying the new information that's been learnt to your job alone can help stimulate your brain. Learning can challenge you, which again can contribute to making you more interested in you work. So if you feel like you are losing interest in your career, be sure to sign up to a new skill as there's a good chance that the mental stimuli provided by the process of learning will help you find meaning in your career again.\n Sometimes, when someone has not stepped out of their routine for a while, and they haven't taken on any new challenges or really applied themselves to learning something new, they may find the experience a bit daunting. Lifelong learning will help anyone overcome this fear and allow you to gain confidence in ability to learn and to share information with others; gain confidence in who we are and what we have to offer.\n Lifelong learning not only impacts the learner, but all has many benefits to the employers, which is why so many businesses offer training and development opportunities. If the employer is offering training opportunities to staff for a chance to learn skills and develop those that they may already have, it will show how much the organisation values the employees. Companies and organisations need to foster the culture of learning by providing the resources, tools and time to facilitate the learning of new skills. The end result will be a company that can confidently face challenges and stay on the cusp of innovation.",

It is not intended to cover dealing with the deceased's estate etc.\n If an immediate family member dies you may be granted paid special leave up to a maximum of five days. An immediate family member means a spouse, partner, civil partner, child, mother, father, brother, sister and parent-in-law.\n At the discretion of your line manager one day's special leave may be granted to attend the funeral of a close friend or relative. A relative could be, for example, an uncle, aunt, grandparent, brother in-law or sister-in-law.\n The relationships described above are examples only and are not exhaustive lists. Special Leave is at the discretion of the line manager and the HR team. In considering the amount of Special Leave appropriate, an employee's particular circumstances will always be considered. These considerations are likely to include the nature of the relationship with the deceased, the extent to which other family members are available to provide support, the employee's responsibilities in relation to the deceased, how far away the deceased lived and where the funeral is to be held.\n In addition to paragraphs 1.3 and 4 - 4.5 above, compassionate leave may be granted, for example in the event of serious ill health or a serious situation occurring of, or involving, a close family member, spouse or partner. Time off will be at the discretion of the line manager and will normally be unpaid, however a short period of paid compassionate leave may be granted. In addition, or as an alternative, annual leave may be granted at short notice if longer leave is required.\n If an employee suffers an unexpected domestic emergency, for example burst pipes, unpaid special leave or annual leave may be granted at short notice, to make arrangements to resolve the initial emergency.\n If an employee chooses to undergo medical or surgical treatment for cosmetic purposes, neither special leave nor sick leave are appropriate for either the procedure or recovery.\n If however the elective medical or surgical treatment is required to rectify a medical condition, this will be covered by sick leave.\n Contact should be made with the Learning and Development Adviser, Ministries Council.\n Exceptionally, up to four weeks unpaid leave may be granted to supplement annual leave to allow an employee to take a holiday for a period longer than their annual leave entitlement.",

      "Left": "In absence of his family , he made new friends and acquaintances . Friends living nearby would come to his apartment for conversation and good food — cooking was Dunstan 's hobby . Dunstan bought another house in 1974 , partially financed from a then-unpublished cookbook . In 1976 , Don Dunstan 's Cookbook was published — the first cookbook released by a serving Australian leader . More generally , Dunstan promoted a revolution in fine dining in the state . Encouraged by Dunstan 's enthusiasm for multiculturalism , many new restaurants were opened by proprietors and the diversity of cuisine increased . He also promoted the viticulture industry through his patronage of wine festivals .\n Having played a part in Labor 's abandonment of the White Australia Policy at national level , Dunstan was also prominent in promoting multiculturalism . He was well known for his attendance at and patronage of Cornish , Italian and Greek Australian cultural festivals and his appreciation of Asian art , and sought to build on cultural respect to create trade links with Asia . Dunstan 's involvement in such cultural exchanges was also credited with generating strong support for Labor from ethnic and non-Anglo-Saxon immigrant communities , although it was viewed with suspicion by some in the Anglo-Saxon establishment . Dunstan himself later recalled : \" When I proposed the establishment of a Cornish Festival , in Australia 's \" Little Cornwall \" , people of Cornish descent came flocking . \" \n  Having been vocal in criticising Playford for sacrificing heritage to the march of development , Dunstan was prominent in protecting historic buildings from being bulldozed for high-rise office blocks . In 1972 , the government intervened to purchase and thereby save Edmund Wright House on King William Street from being replaced with a skyscraper . In 1975 , the Customs House at Semaphore was purchased to save it from demolition . His support of heritage preservation overlapped with his promotion of gourmet dining when his personal efforts helped to save the historic Ayers House on North Terrace , having it converted into a restaurant to avoid demolition . In contrast , there were also some controversial developments . Part of the rocky Hallett Cove on Gulf St Vincent in Adelaide 's southern suburbs was developed for housing , as were vineyards in Morphettville , Tea Tree Gully , Modbury , and <unk> . This attracted criticism , as Dunstan was prominent in promoting South Australian viticulture and enotourism .",
      "Right": "Over a six-year period , government funding for the arts was increased by a factor of seven and in 1978 , the South Australian Film Corporation commenced work . During Dunstan 's time in charge , acclaimed films such as Breaker Morant , Picnic at Hanging Rock and Storm Boy were made in the state . Dunstan 's support of the arts and fine dining was credited by commentators with attracting artists , craftspeople and writers into the state , helping to change its atmosphere .\n The South Australian Legislative Council , the Upper House in the Parliament , was , due to its limited electoral roll , overwhelmingly non-Labor . Unlike the Lower House , its members were elected only by voters who met certain property and wealth requirements . Combined with the remains of the \" Playmander \" malapportionment , it was difficult for the Labor Party to achieve the representation it wished . The Legislative Council either watered down or outright rejected a considerable amount of Labor legislation ; bills to legalise homosexuality , abolish corporal and capital punishment and allow gambling and casinos were rejected . A referendum had indicated support for Friday night shopping , but Labor legislation was blocked in the upper house by the LCL .\n Dunstan called an election for March 1973 , hoping to gain a mandate to seek changes to the Council . The LCL were badly disunited ; the more liberal wing of the party under Hall joined Dunstan in wanting to introduce universal suffrage for the upper house , while the more conservative members of the LCL did not . The conservatives then decided to limit Hall 's powers , resulting in his resignation and creation of the breakaway Liberal Movement ( LM ) , which overtly branded itself as a semi-autonomous component within the LCL . Labor capitalised on the opposition divisions to secure an easy victory . They campaigned under the slogan \" South Australia 's Doing Well with Labor \" , while the LCL was hampered by infighting ; many LCL candidates were claiming different leaders in their electoral material depending on their factional allegiance . The Labor Party won with 51.5 % of the primary vote and secured a second consecutive majority government with 26 seats . It was only the second time that a Labor government in South Australia had been re-elected for a second term , the first being the early Thomas Price Labor government . It would be the first five-year-incumbent Labor government however . They also gained two more seats in the Legislative Council to have six of the twenty members .",

      "Outcome2": "As part of his vision to foster economic ties with the nations of South-East Asia, Dunstan visited the Malaysian state of Penang in 1973 and met with its Chief Minister, Chong Eu Lim. Dunstan and Chong found common ground in their progressive policies and their interest in cultural diversity. They agreed to launch a series of exchange programs between the two states, starting with \"Penang Week\" in Adelaide in July, followed by \"South Australia Week\" in Penang's capital, George Town. These events showcased the arts, crafts, cuisine, tourism and trade opportunities of each state, and attracted significant public and media attention. Dunstan hoped that by strengthening the cultural and economic links with Penang, he could boost South Australia's exports, attract foreign investment and diversify its workforce. He also saw it as a way to promote his multicultural agenda and counter the xenophobia and racism that still lingered in some sections of Australian society. In the same year, Dunstan opened the Adelaide Festival Centre, a landmark project that reflected his passion for the arts and his ambition to make Adelaide a cultural hub for the region. The Festival Centre was Australia's first multifunction performing arts complex, featuring theatres, galleries, restaurants and bars. It hosted local and international performances and exhibitions, drawing large crowds and critical acclaim. Dunstan believed that by investing in the arts, he could enhance South Australia's reputation as a creative and innovative state, attract talented artists and professionals from diverse backgrounds, and enrich the quality of life for its citizens.",
      "Outcome3": "While Dunstan was building bridges with Penang, a Malaysian state with a vibrant multicultural heritage, he faced resistance from the conservative forces in his own state. He initiated cultural and economic exchanges with Penang's Chief Minister Chong Eu Lim, celebrating the diversity and creativity of both states. He also opened the Adelaide Festival Centre, a pioneering venue for performing arts in Australia. However, his progressive agenda was frustrated by the South Australian Legislative Council, which had an undemocratic electoral system that favoured the non-Labor parties. The Council blocked or diluted many of Dunstan's reforms, such as legalising homosexuality, abolishing capital punishment and allowing casinos.",

      "Outcome5": "Don liked to visit other places and make friends with people who lived there. One place he visited was called Penang, and it was very far away from where he lived. The people who were in charge of Penang liked Don and wanted to learn more about his place too. So they decided to have special weeks where they showed each other their food, music, stories and art. Don also helped to build a big place where people could do different kinds of shows and have fun.",
      "Outcome6": "As part of his vision to foster economic ties with the neighbouring region of South-East Asia , Dunstan travelled to the Malaysian state of Penang in 1973 and met with its Chief Minister , Chong Eu Lim .

As a result , a series of events were organised to showcase each other's arts , cuisine and tourism . The first \" Penang Week \" was held in Adelaide in July 1973 , featuring exhibitions , performances and demonstrations of Penang 's culture and heritage . In return , Dunstan led a delegation to Penang later that year for the inaugural \" South Australia Week \" , which highlighted South Australia 's achievements and attractions in various fields . During this visit , Dunstan also inaugurated the Adelaide Festival Centre , the first multifunction performing arts complex in Australia , which he saw as a symbol of his commitment to the arts .",

      "Left": "Evidence suggests that after the collapse of the Hopewell , Indiana had a low population until the rise of the Fort Ancient and Mississippian culture around 900 AD . The Ohio River Valley was densely populated by the Mississippians from about 1100 to 1450 AD . Their settlements , like those of the Hopewell , were known for their ceremonial earthwork mounds . Some of these remain visible at locations near the Ohio River . The Mississippian mounds were constructed on a grander scale than the mounds built by the Hopewell . The agrarian Mississippian culture was the first to grow maize in the region . The people also developed the bow and arrow and copper working during this time period .\n Mississippian society was complex , dense , and highly developed ; the largest Mississippian city of Cahokia ( in Illinois ) contained as many as 30,000 inhabitants . They had a class society with certain groups specializing as artisans . The elite held related political and religious positions . Their cities were typically sited near rivers . Representing their cosmology , the central developments were dominated by a large central mound , several smaller mounds , and a large open plaza . Wooden palisades were built later around the complex , apparently for defensive purposes . The remains of a major settlement known as Angel Mounds lie east of present-day Evansville . Mississippian houses were generally square-shaped with plastered walls and thatched roofs . For reasons that remain unclear , the Mississippians disappeared in the middle of the 15th century , about 200 years before the Europeans first entered what would become modern Indiana . Mississippian culture marked the high point of native development in Indiana .",
      "Right": "Before 1600 , a major war broke out in eastern North America among Native Americans ; it was later called the Beaver Wars . Five American Indian Iroquois tribes confederated to battle against their neighbors . The Iroquois were opposed by a confederation of primarily Algonquian tribes including the Shawnee , Miami , Wea , Pottawatomie , and the Illinois . These tribes were significantly less advanced than the Mississippian culture that had preceded them . The tribes were semi-nomadic , used stone tools rather than copper , and did not create the large-scale construction and farming works of their Mississippian predecessors . The war continued with sporadic fighting for at least a century as the Iroquois sought to dominate the expanding fur trade with the Europeans . They achieved this goal for several decades . During the war , the Iroquois drove the tribes from the Ohio Valley to the south and west . They kept control of the area for hunting grounds .\n As a result of the war , several tribes , including the Shawnee , migrated into Indiana , where they attempted to resettle in land belonging to the Miami . The Iroquois gained the military advantage after they were supplied with firearms by the Europeans . With their superior weapons , the Iroquois subjugated at least thirty tribes and nearly destroyed several others in northern Indiana .",

      "Outcome1": "It was during this period that American Bison began a periodic east – west trek through Indiana , crossing the Falls of the Ohio and the Wabash River near modern-day Vincennes . These herds became important to civilizations in southern Indiana and created a well-established Buffalo Trace , later used by European-American pioneers moving west .",
      "Outcome2": "During this time, many American Bison came and went through Indiana. They crossed two big rivers on their way. People in southern Indiana used these animals for many things. They also made a clear path for people who came later from the east.",
      "Outcome3": "As the bison began to roam across Indiana in large numbers, they had a profound impact on the native cultures and the environment. The bison provided a valuable source of food, clothing, and tools for the tribes that hunted them, especially the Miami and the Illinois. The bison also shaped the landscape by grazing, trampling, and fertilizing the grasslands and creating trails that connected different regions. The bison migration attracted other predators and scavengers, such as wolves, bears, and vultures, creating a diverse and dynamic ecosystem. However, the bison also posed a challenge to the native cultures, as they competed with them for land and resources. The bison could damage crops and fences, spread diseases, and provoke conflicts among tribes over hunting rights. The bison migration was both a blessing and a curse for the native peoples of Indiana.",
      "Outcome4": "During this time, American Bison started to migrate through Indiana along the Buffalo Trace, a route that later pioneers used. The bison herds were vital for the southern Indiana civilizations.",
      "Outcome5": "During this time, some big animals with horns called bison started to walk across Indiana. They made a big path that people could follow. Some people who lived in big cities with hills of dirt moved away and nobody knows why. They were very good at growing corn and making things from metal. They also used bows and arrows to hunt.",
      "Outcome6": "During this time of cultural change, a new animal also entered the region: the American Bison. These massive creatures began to migrate eastward from the Great Plains, following a seasonal route that took them across Indiana. They crossed the Ohio River at the Falls of the Ohio and the Wabash River near modern-day Vincennes, creating well-worn paths that became known as Buffalo Traces. The bison provided a valuable source of food, clothing, and trade goods for the native peoples of southern Indiana, who hunted them with bows and arrows. The Buffalo Traces also served as routes for travel and communication among different tribes and later for European-American settlers moving westward.",

They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life.",

Indeed, when a student comprehends a fact and its implications, he or she can deal with it more confidently. In my perspective, fears and anxieties are very detrimental in everyone's life. They can hinder one's progress and success in any situation.",
      "Outcome2": "Furthermore, learning facts can help students cope with their fears and concerns more effectively. According to a study by Kornell and Bjork (2008), factual knowledge can enhance metacognitive judgments and reduce overconfidence errors. This means that when students have a solid grasp of the facts, they can better assess their own understanding and avoid making mistakes due to false beliefs. Therefore, by learning facts, students can face reality with more confidence and less anxiety. In my opinion, fears and concerns are very detrimental to one's life, as they can hinder one's progress and success in any situation.",

As a result, they can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. They can prevent a person from progressing and thriving in any situation.",
      "Outcome4": "Also, this way students learn to face facts with less fear and worry. In fact, when a student knows a fact and its outcomes, he or she can handle it more confidently. I think fear and worry are very harmful in life. They can stop people from growing and succeeding in any situation.",
      "Outcome5": "Another good thing about learning facts is that it helps students to be brave and calm when they face real things. Sometimes, when we don't know much about something, we feel scared or worried about it. But when we learn more facts about it, we can understand it better and not be afraid of it. I think being brave and calm is very important for everyone. It can help us to do better in school and in life.",
      "Outcome6": "Furthermore, by learning facts, students can also learn how to cope with their fears and worries when they face reality. Sometimes, students may have unrealistic or distorted expectations based on theoretical concepts, which can cause them anxiety or disappointment when they encounter real situations. However, when a student has a factual understanding of a phenomenon and its implications, he or she can approach it more confidently and rationally. In my opinion, fears and worries are very harmful for anyone's life. They can hinder one's progress and success in any field.",

      "Left": "One possible way to reorganize the document into new paragraphs based on semantic similarity is:\nDocument:\nProposal :\n\"I would like for the subcommittee to consider completely dropping the FORGIVE option on the patron Bills screen. \"\n\"It really cause a lot of trouble with a library system that uses a collection agency. To a collection agency it means/equals cash and we have to pay the amount that is forgiven. I have been known to contact the library whose staff had performed the action to get our money back. I think it is partly in the training of the circ staff that this occurs. PINES Policy on page 33 has a section on Collection/Materials Recovery Agencies. The patron who has been sent to collections should contact the library where the fines/fees were created. That is also found in the policy under Paying Fines/Fees (pg.31). If they want to pay somewhere else, the price of the book, processing or fines and fee should be all sent to the library who has the patron in collection status. If an item should truly be forgiven, because the item was found on our shelves or some other valid reason, we can use GOODS or WORK. They do not affect our bill to Unique. Thank you for at least considering this.\"",
      "Right": "Responses from Directors who are not Subcommittee Members:\nA needed option.\n Absolutely not. Systems NOT using a collection agency use this feature. This is a training issue, not a system issue.\n I can understand the reason behind the request. However, I do not like the thought of using GOODS as a substitution. We use the goods feature during food for fines. I believe the terminology should reflect what in reality has happened. When we find the item on the shelf, the fines are forgiven. When checking out to a patron, Evergreen will even recommend forgiving if the item is still checked out to another patron. Is it possible for the affected libraries to work with the collection agency so Forgive has the same meaning as Goods?\nI don't like this. If the problem is with the collecting agency, then they need to ensure that the company does interpret forgive as money. We use goods when we use food for fines. I don't like the idea of using terminology incorrectly.\n I feel that many small rural county systems need this when an individual has special circumstances. This is used when there is a death, sickness, and etc. Otherwise we do not use the forgive, but within the pines system each system has different Patron types and needs and this would be why we need several different functions to manage our on Patron's needs.\n I like having the Forgive option for dealing with a Griffin fine on the fly when there is a patron/customer service issue. I don't think I would use Forgive on a fine for another library, and I know I would not on a charge that has been sent to collections. I would leave the option in place.\n I think \"forgive\" serves a useful function to many library systems and should remain. If it is possible to change \"forgive\" to a local option, then I think that would be fine.\n I understand the concern that Mrs. Griffis has on this matter, however I believe she has hit on the problem; training. However if they are a patron of another system they MUST go to, or contact, the system that they are in collections at to resolve the problem. To take away the forgive option, in my opinion, would be taking away a valid function of the system. As Mrs. Griffis points out, there are times items are missed and shelved without being checked in; mistakes happen to us all. At times like that it would be prudent to use the FORGIVE feature in PINES.",

Therefore, more capable or wealthier citizens should offer their aids, which can greatly supplement government support.

As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. According to the World Bank, in 2015, there were still 736 million people living in extreme poverty globally, and many of them lacked access to basic services such as health care and education. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department. A study by Sampson et al. (1997) found that collective efficacy, which refers to the willingness of residents to intervene for the common good, was a significant predictor of lower crime rates in neighbourhoods.",
      "Outcome3": "Nevertheless, paying tax is not the only responsibility that citizens should fulfil for the society. They also have other important roles to play, especially when it comes to helping the less fortunate and protecting the public order. For instance, some people in our society are suffering from poverty or disability, and they need more assistance than what the government can offer. Therefore, it is vital for those who have more resources or abilities to lend a hand and supplement the government's efforts. Another example is that citizens should cooperate with the police force to maintain social stability, as there are always criminals who threaten the safety of everyone. The government cannot afford to hire enough policemen to patrol every corner of the society, so it is up to the local residents to be vigilant and report any suspicious activities to the police department.",
      "Outcome4": "Yet, paying tax is not the only duty of citizens. They should also help the needy and the disabled, who cannot rely on government fund alone. They should also cooperate with the police to keep social order, as the police force is limited and needs local support.",
      "Outcome5": "But paying tax is not the only thing citizens should do. Sometimes, there are people who are very poor or sick, and they need help from others. The government can give them some money, but that is not enough. So other people who have more money or are healthy should also help them, because that is a nice thing to do. Another thing citizens should do is to keep their neighborhoods safe and clean. There are bad people who want to hurt others or steal things, and the police try to stop them. But the police cannot be everywhere all the time, so other people should also watch out and tell the police if they see something wrong.",
      "Outcome6": "However, paying tax is not the only responsibility that citizens have to fulfil. In addition to contributing to the government's revenue, citizens also have a moral duty to help those who are less fortunate or more vulnerable in the society. There are many people who suffer from poverty, disability, illness or other disadvantages, and they cannot rely on the government alone to improve their situation. They need more assistance and compassion from their fellow citizens, who can donate money, time or skills to various charitable organizations or causes. By doing so, citizens can show their social responsibility and solidarity, and make the society more humane and fair. Another responsibility that citizens should not neglect is to cooperate with the police force in maintaining social order and security. No matter how much the government invests in law enforcement, there will always be some criminals who pose threats to the public safety and property. Therefore, it is essential for the citizens to be vigilant and proactive in preventing and reporting crimes in their neighborhoods, by forming community watch groups, installing surveillance cameras or contacting the police department when they witness something suspicious.",

      "Left": "A long stream of literature investigates how financial constraints and access to resources affect capital expenditures and R&D investments (see, e.g., Weitzman (1979), Kaplan and Zingales (1997), and Scharfstein and Stein (2000), Hsu, Tian, Xu (2010)). These papers, as with many others, consider the aggregate level of innovation, as measured by research and development expenditures in early papers or the number and quality of patents in more recent papers, whereas we focus on the degree (the riskiness) of innovation.\nPapers that examine the degree of innovation include Bhattacharya and Mookherjee (1986), Dasgupta and Maskin (1987), and Klette and de Meza (1986), who observe that competing firms facing a payoff that rewards a single winner may choose more risky innovation than they would in the absence of such competition, Amihud and Lev (1981), who suggest that diversifying mergers are taken by risk averse managers to hedge employment risk, and Gervais, Heaton, and Odean (2009), who note that overconfidence encourages a risk-averse manager to take riskier projects, which reduces the cost of providing compensation incentives to do so. While focused on issues related to the riskiness of firm investment, these studies do not address the impact of financial constraints on innovation.\n The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss our data and define our distance measure.\n While we cannot observe the exact allocation of resources between various R&D activities we can observe the resulting patents. The patenting activity is considered by the literature (see, e.g., Jaffe(1986)) to be a close proxy of the pursued R&D activity. In this study we propose a measure of the degree (riskiness) of innovation that is based on the observable results of R&D activity (patents) at different points in time. We build upon intuition provided by Stuart and Podolny (1996) and Jaffe (1986) who evaluate the distance between firms or industries via analysis of patents in different technological classes defined by USPTO and/or Hall et al (2001). Our measure acknowledges both the distribution of patents across different classes as well as the degree of relatedness of patent classes.",
      "Right": "Second, we construct a matrix which represents the degree of relatedness between patent classes. In particular, the matrix Rt is a 37 by 37 matrix where each element rkl represents the proportion of all patent citations in technological class l that cite patent class k:\nWe are therefore using the degree of patent citations as in indicator of relatedness.\n This measure captures the how a firm's patent portfolio is evolving over time. It allows us to gauge the extent to which a firm is venturing into new technological areas while acknowledging the relatedness of those areas - that technological classes are not independent and have significant knowledge spillover. We can therefore discriminate between firms that venture into a completely new patent class (e.g., a software firm venturing from computers into transportation) and firms that venture into a related area (e.g., a chemical company that ventures from organic compounds to resins).\n An intuitive way to interpret the distance measure is as follows. Each column of the matrix Rt represents the composition of knowledge necessary to produce a patent in a respective technological class. Our measure of the degree of innovation measures the distance between these knowledge bases.\n For each year we use the past five years of citation data to compute the elements of Rt. One can see that while most citations take place within one technological class, a significant share of citations (sometimes up to 30%) take place between technological classes. This emphasizes that some technological classes cannot be considered unrelated to one another. Overall, the rolling nature of the Rt matrix allows us to account for the changing landscape of technological knowledge while providing a steady measure of interrelatedness.\n We present a detailed example of technological search distance calculations in the Appendix. It illustrates that while our new distance measure builds on the work of Stuart and Podolny (1996) and Jaffe(1986), we further the approach and propose a measure that allows to capture not only the direction of the patenting across technological classes but also the depth and inter-relatedness of such activities.\n Following the methodology above we measure technological search distance for U.S. public corporations based on the NBER patent data for firms that applied for at least one patent between 1980-2002. Our sample contains 1,022,478 such patents and spans a wide variety of industries ranging from electronics and medical equipment to business services and pharmaceuticals. We limit our sample to firm-year observations dated between",
      "Passage": "First, we represent the patent activity of a firm as a column vector equal in length to the number of technological classes where each element reflects the proportion of patents in that patent class."

      "Left": "BACKGROUND: BK virus nephropathy is an emerging and significant cause of graft loss following renal transplantation. A recent study suggested that around 40% of BK viral tubulitis cases result in graft failure within five years of diagnosis. However, there are no defined standards guiding the need for serum BK viral screening following renal transplantation or an appropriate time schedule for such a programme. Many centres undertake testing upon identifying graft dysfunction whereas others routinely screen. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence of managing the results of viraemia or tubulitis. We undertook a retrospective study to assess our local rates of BK virus detection following transplantation to inform a local standard for screening and management.\n AIMS: To assess the indication, number and timing of BK viral screening tests undertaken over a three year period following all renal transplants in NHS Fife.\n METHODS: A list of all renal transplants undertaken in NHS Fife from January 2011 to December 2013 inclusive was obtained from the 'proton' renal electronic patient record. This was compared to a list of all BK viral DNA PCR blood tests conducted for the same period obtained from the microbiology laboratory. Indication for viral screening was identified from the electronic patient record. Transplant biopsies were identified from the renal EPR and lab database.",
      "Right": "CONCLUSION: In this small cohort of thirty five incident renal transplant recipients, the rate of identified BK nephropathy was 5.7%. Both cases were identified during investigation of graft dysfunction by renal biopsy. However, one of these had been identified by prior screening in the early post transplant period and changes to immunosuppression already made. Although the results indicate a non-uniform and variable approach to BK viral screening following renal transplantation in NHS Fife, all cases of graft dysfunction were appropriately investigated including viral studies and biopsy where appropriate. It is unlikely that clinically significant nephropathy cases have been overlooked by this approach.\n RELEVANCE: It is not known whether BK viraemia in the absence of biochemical graft dysfunction poses a subsequent risk of graft problems. One case in the cohort had viraemia identified on screening some weeks before showing graft dysfunction, by which time immunosuppression had already been adjusted. We have shown a significant incidence of BK viraemia in this cohort. We feel that our findings support the routine testing for BK virus following renal transplantation.",
      "Passage": "RESULTS: The total number of renal transplants undertaking in NHS Fife during the study period was thirty five. Sixteen of the thirty five patients were tested for BK virus during follow up. Of those sixteen patients the time lapse between transplant and first BK viral screening were as follows: 0-3 months (3), 3-6 months (1), 6-9 months (5), not known (7). The indications were as follows; graft dysfunction (9), random screening (7). Of the nine patients tested for graft dysfunction, only three had viraemia identified and one had graft failure. Of the seven patients tested on screening, four had sustained viraemia without graft dysfunction and one was later investigated for graft dysfunction when biopsy suggested tubulitis. Testing for BK viraemia was mostly undertaken investigating change in graft function which occurred in 25.7% (n9) revealing viraemia in three. BK virus screening in the absence of graft dysfunction was undertaken in 20% (n7) revealing viraemia in four. The remaining 54% (n19) of patients were not tested and had uneventful follow up."

      "Outcome3": "RESULTS: The total number of renal transplants undertaken in NHS Fife during the study period was thirty five. Out of these, sixteen patients underwent BK viral screening at some point during their follow up. The time lapse between transplant and first BK viral screening varied widely, ranging from 0 to 9 months or not known in seven cases. The main indication for viral screening was graft dysfunction, which prompted testing in nine patients. Of these, only three had viraemia detected and one eventually lost the graft. On the other hand, seven patients were tested as part of a random screening programme, and four of them had sustained viraemia without any evidence of graft dysfunction. One of these patients later developed graft dysfunction and was confirmed to have tubulitis on biopsy. In summary, testing for BK viraemia was mostly done in response to changes in graft function, which occurred in 25.7% (n9) of the cohort and revealed viraemia in three cases. Conversely, BK virus screening in the absence of graft dysfunction was done in 20% (n7) of the cohort and revealed viraemia in four cases. The remaining 54% (n19) of patients were not tested and had uneventful follow up.",
      "Outcome4": "RESULTS: Of 35 renal transplants in NHS Fife from 2011 to 2013, 16 were tested for BK virus. The main indication was graft dysfunction (9/16), which revealed viraemia in 3 cases, one leading to graft failure. Random screening (7/16) detected viraemia in 4 cases without graft dysfunction, one later developing tubulitis. No BK nephropathy was missed among the untested patients (19/35).",
      "Outcome5": "RESULTS: We looked at 35 people who had new kidneys put in them. We checked their blood to see if they had a bad germ that can hurt their kidneys. Sometimes we checked because their kidneys were not working well. Sometimes we checked just to be careful. We found that 9 people had the bad germ in their blood. Two of them had very sick kidneys and one of them lost their new kidney. The other 7 people did not have very sick kidneys, but we gave them different medicines to try to stop the bad germ. The rest of the people did not have the bad germ and their kidneys were fine.",
      "Outcome6": "RESULTS: During the study period, thirty five patients received a renal transplant in NHS Fife. Of these, sixteen patients underwent BK viral screening at some point during their follow up. The time interval between the transplant and the first BK viral test varied from less than three months to more than nine months. The reasons for requesting BK viral testing were either graft dysfunction or routine screening. Among the nine patients who were tested for graft dysfunction, three had positive BK viraemia and one of them eventually lost their graft. Among the seven patients who were tested as part of routine screening, four had persistent BK viraemia without any signs of graft dysfunction and one of them developed graft dysfunction later on, which was confirmed by biopsy as tubulitis. Therefore, out of the sixteen patients who were tested for BK virus, six had positive viraemia and two had biopsy-proven nephropathy. The remaining nineteen patients who were not tested had stable graft function and no evidence of nephropathy. This suggests that our approach to BK viral testing was mainly driven by clinical suspicion of graft dysfunction, which occurred in 25.7% (n9) of our cohort and revealed viraemia in three cases. However, we also detected BK viraemia in 20% (n7) of our cohort who did not have graft dysfunction at the time of testing. The clinical significance and long-term outcome of these cases are unclear.",

Meanwhile , she was going through turbulent divorce proceedings with Stevenson ; the court case ended in 1976 , with her not getting the half-share in the Stone Balloon she had wanted .\n She and Joe Biden were married by a Catholic priest on June 17 , 1977 , at the Chapel at the United Nations in New York City . This was four and a half years after his first wife and infant daughter died in a motor vehicle accident ; Joe had proposed several times before she accepted , hesitant to take on the commitment of raising his two young sons who had survived the accident . She continued to teach and then , while pregnant , received a Master of Education with a specialty in Reading from West Chester University in 1981 . The Bidens ' daughter Ashley Blazer was born on June 8 , 1981 , and Jill stopped working for two years while raising the three children .\n She then returned to work , teaching English , acting as a reading specialist , and teaching history to emotionally disturbed students .

In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents.",
      "Right": "Finally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.",
      "Passage": "Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school."

      "Outcome3": "Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. However, nothing can replace the value of seeing them live and learning from direct observation. By visiting the zoo, you can witness the diversity of animal life, their adaptations, their diets and their social interactions. You can also compare the differences between males and females or between young and old animals of the same species. Furthermore, you can learn how animals respond to various stimuli, such as changes in weather, threats from predators or rivals, or care for their offspring. You can also identify which animals pose a potential danger to humans or other animals. According to a study by Falk et al. (2007), zoo visits can enhance students' scientific learning outcomes by providing them with memorable experiences that reinforce classroom knowledge.",

When you go to the zoo, you can see many kinds of animals. You can see how big or small they are, what color they have, what they like to eat, and how they play with each other. You can also see if they are boys or girls, or if they have babies. Sometimes the animals do funny things that make you laugh. Sometimes they do things that show you how smart or brave they are. You can learn a lot from watching the animals at the zoo.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main benefits of visiting the zoo is that it provides a rich and engaging learning experience for people of all ages. Animals are fascinating subjects that can teach us many things about the natural world, the diversity of life, and the interdependence of ecosystems. By visiting the zoo, we can observe animals in their simulated habitats, learn about their unique features and adaptations, and compare and contrast different species and groups. We can also witness how animals behave in various situations, such as socializing with their own kind or other species, defending themselves from threats, caring for their offspring, or coping with different weather conditions. Additionally, we can recognize which animals are potentially dangerous and how to avoid them. Visiting the zoo can complement and enhance what we learn from books and classes by giving us a firsthand and memorable experience.",

      "Passage": "In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive."

      "Outcome1": "Another good thing about e-mail is that it helps people say what they really think. Some people feel shy or silly when they talk to someone face-to-face. Sometimes, they cannot say their ideas clearly. For example, I want to tell my friend that she needs to change her behavior, but I don't want to hurt her feelings. E-mail makes it easier for me to tell her. She can read my e-mail without hearing my voice that might make her angry. I don't have to worry about other things that can make my message weak.",
      "Outcome2": "Furthermore, writing e-mail enables people to communicate more honestly. Some people find it difficult to express themselves clearly in face-to-face conversations. They may feel nervous, embarrassed, or intimidated by the other person's reactions. For example, if I want to give my friend some constructive feedback on her behavior, I might not be able to say it directly to her face. She might get defensive or angry and interrupt me. However, if I write her an e-mail, I can explain my point of view calmly and politely. She can read my e-mail at her own pace and think about what I said without feeling pressured. According to a survey by Pew Research Center, 59% of internet users say that e-mail has improved their personal relationships with friends (Pew Internet & American Life Project, 2006). Therefore, e-mail can be a useful tool to help people express their honest opinions.",
      "Outcome3": "Another benefit of writing e-mail is that it allows people to communicate more honestly. Some people feel nervous or awkward in face-to-face conversations and cannot express their thoughts clearly. For example, I want to give my friend some constructive feedback on her behavior, but I am afraid of hurting her feelings or making her angry. Therefore, e-mail will be a better option for me to share my opinion. She will just read my message calmly instead of hearing my voice which might irritate her. I don't have to worry about any other factor that can weaken my argument.",
      "Outcome4": "Another benefit of e-mail is that it allows people to communicate honestly. Some people feel awkward or nervous in face-to-face conversations, and they may not express their ideas clearly. For example, if I need to talk to my friend about a sensitive issue like her behavior, I would rather write an e-mail than confront her directly. She can read my e-mail calmly and understand my point of view, without being offended by my tone or gesture. E-mail helps me avoid unnecessary conflicts and convey my message effectively.",
      "Outcome5": "Another good thing about e-mail is that it can help you say what you really think. Sometimes, when you talk to someone in person, you might feel shy or scared. You might not be able to say what you want to say clearly. For example, if I want to tell my friend that she did something wrong, I might feel bad to look at her and say it. So, e-mail can help me tell her nicely. She can read my e-mail and not hear my voice, which might make her angry. I don't have to worry about anything else that might make her not listen to me.",
      "Outcome6": "Another benefit of writing e-mail is that it allows people to communicate more honestly and openly. Some people may find it difficult to express themselves clearly and confidently in face-to-face conversations, especially when they have to deal with sensitive or controversial topics. For example, if I want to give some constructive feedback to my friend about her behavior, I might feel awkward and hesitant to say it directly to her face. She might also get defensive or angry when she hears my voice and sees my expression. Therefore, e-mail can be a helpful tool for me to share my thoughts and opinions without worrying about the immediate reaction of the other person. She can read my e-mail calmly and objectively, and I can choose the right words and tone to convey my message effectively. By writing e-mail, I can avoid any potential conflicts or misunderstandings that might arise from verbal communication.",

      "Left": "For the 1969 event , Armco barriers were placed at specific points for the first time in the circuit 's history ; before that , the circuit 's conditions were ( aside from the removal of people 's production cars parked on the side of the road ) virtually identical to everyday civilian use . If a driver went off , he would crash into whatever was next to the track ( buildings , trees , lamp posts , glass windows , and even a train station ) ; and in Alberto Ascari and Paul Hawkins ' cases , the harbour water , because the concrete road the course used had no Armco to protect the drivers from going off the track and into the Mediterranean . The circuit gained more Armco in specific points for the next 2 races , and by 1972 , the circuit was almost completely Armco-lined . And for the first time in its history , the Monaco circuit was altered that year ; the pits were moved next to the waterfront straight between the chicane and Tabac and the chicane was moved further forward right before Tabac and was the junction point between the pits and the course . The course was changed again for the 1973 race ; the Rainier III Nautical Stadium was constructed where the straight that went behind the pits was and the circuit introduced a twisty section that went around the new swimming pool . This created space for a whole new pit facility ; and in 1976 the course was altered yet again ; the Sainte Devote corner was made slower and a chicane was placed right before the pit straight .\n For the next two races , By the early 1970s , as Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone started to marshal the collective bargaining power of the Formula One Constructors Association ( FOCA ) , Monaco was prestigious enough to become an early bone of contention . Historically the number of cars permitted in a race was decided by the race organiser , in this case the ACM , which had always set a low number of around 16 . In 1972 Ecclestone was starting to negotiate deals which relied on FOCA guaranteeing at least 18 entrants for every race . A stand-off over this issue left the 1972 race in jeopardy until the ACM gave in and agreed that 26 cars could participate – the same number permitted at most other circuits . Two years later , in 1974 , the ACM managed to get the numbers back down to 18 .",
      "Right": "In 1983 the ACM became entangled in the disagreements between Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile ( FISA ) and FOCA . The ACM , with the agreement of Bernie Ecclestone , negotiated an individual television rights deal with ABC in the United States . This broke an agreement enforced by FISA for a single central negotiation of television rights . Jean-Marie Balestre , president of FISA , announced that the Monaco Grand Prix would not form part of the Formula One world championship in 1985 . The ACM fought their case in the French courts . They won the case and the race was eventually reinstated .",
      "Passage": "Because of its tight confines , slow average speeds and punishing nature , Monaco has often thrown up unexpected results . In the 1982 race René Arnoux led the first 15 laps , before retiring . Alain Prost then led until four laps from the end , when he spun off on the wet track , hit the barriers and lost a wheel , giving Riccardo Patrese the lead . Patrese himself spun with only a lap and a half to go , letting Didier Pironi through to the front , followed by Andrea de Cesaris . On the last lap , Pironi ran out of fuel in the tunnel , but De Cesaris also ran out of fuel before he could overtake . In the meantime Patrese had bump-started his car and went through to score his first Grand Prix win ."

Alain Prost then led until four laps from the end , when he spun off on the wet track , hit the barriers and lost a wheel , giving Riccardo Patrese the lead . Patrese himself spun with only a lap and a half to go , letting Didier Pironi through to the front , followed by Andrea de Cesaris . On the last lap , Pironi ran out of fuel in the tunnel , but De Cesaris also ran out of fuel before he could overtake . In the meantime Patrese had bump-started his car and went through to score his first Grand Prix win .\n\nThe race was a rollercoaster of emotions for the drivers and teams involved . Prost, who had dominated most of the weekend, was devastated by his mistake and said: \"I just lost concentration for a fraction of a second. It's very hard to accept\". Patrese, who had been struggling with gearbox problems, was shocked by his victory and said: \"I thought it was all over when I spun. I couldn't believe it when I saw Pironi and de Cesaris stop on the last lap\". Pironi, who had inherited the lead from Prost, was frustrated by his fuel miscalculation and said: \"We had a problem with the fuel gauge. We thought we had enough, but we were wrong\". De Cesaris, who had been chasing Pironi for his maiden win, was disappointed by his luck and said: \"It's unbelievable. I was so close to winning my first race. I don't know what happened with the fuel\".",
      "Outcome2": "Monaco's difficulty and unpredictability stem from its narrow and twisty layout, which leaves little room for error and overtaking. The weather can also play a crucial role, as the track surface changes from dry to wet and back again. In the 1982 race, several drivers experienced misfortune as they tried to cope with the changing conditions. René Arnoux was leading comfortably until he retired with an engine failure. Alain Prost seemed set to inherit the win until he lost control on a damp patch and crashed. Riccardo Patrese then took the lead, but he also spun on the slippery track, allowing Didier Pironi and Andrea de Cesaris to pass him. However, both of them ran out of fuel on the final lap, giving Patrese a chance to recover and claim his maiden Grand Prix victory.",
      "Outcome3": "Monaco often had surprising results because of its difficult track. In 1982, many drivers who were leading the race had problems and retired. Riccardo Patrese won after spinning and recovering on the last lap.",
      "Outcome4": "Monaco's tight and tricky layout often produced surprises . In 1982 , several leaders crashed or ran out of fuel in the wet conditions , allowing Patrese to win after recovering from a spin .",
      "Outcome5": "Some drivers were very good at driving on this road. They could go very fast and not crash. But sometimes they had bad luck and something went wrong with their car or the road was wet and slippery. Then they crashed or stopped and other drivers could go past them. One time, three drivers had bad luck on the last part of the race and a fourth driver who was behind them got to win the race.",
      "Outcome6": "Monaco is a circuit that often rewards the skill and courage of the drivers, but also has a high potential for surprises and upsets. One of the most dramatic races in Monaco's history took place in 1982, when the lead changed hands several times in the closing laps. René Arnoux was the initial leader, but he retired with engine problems after 15 laps. His teammate Alain Prost then took over the lead and looked set to win, until he lost control of his car on the wet track and crashed into the barriers, breaking his front wheel. This handed the lead to Riccardo Patrese, who seemed to have inherited a lucky victory. However, Patrese also made a mistake and spun his car at Loews hairpin with only one and a half laps to go. He stalled his engine and was passed by Didier Pironi and Andrea de Cesaris, who moved into first and second place respectively. On the final lap, Pironi was leading comfortably when he suddenly ran out of fuel in the tunnel. He coasted to a halt on the track, leaving De Cesaris with a golden opportunity to win his first Grand Prix. But De Cesaris also had fuel problems and ran dry before he could catch Pironi. Patrese, who had managed to restart his car by rolling downhill, came back into the picture and passed both Pironi and De Cesaris to take an incredible win.",

The Boodontia are mainly distributed in Africa and Asia, where they inhabit a variety of habitats from forests to savannas. They tend to be large-bodied and have horns that curve backwards or sideways. The Aegodontia are more diverse and widespread, occurring in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America.

The exact number of subfamilies within Bovidae is a matter of debate, as different sources propose anywhere from two to ten subfamilies. However, based on the evidence from molecular, morphological and fossil data, there are eight distinct subfamilies that are widely recognized: Aepycerotinae ( which contains only the impala ) , Alcelaphinae ( which includes <unk> , hartebeest , wildebeest and their relatives ) , Antilopinae ( which encompasses several antelopes , gazelles , and related species ) , Bovinae ( which comprises cattle , buffaloes , bison and some other antelopes ) , Caprinae ( which covers goats , sheep , ibex , serows and their allies ) , Cephalophinae ( which consists of duikers ) , Hippotraginae ( which contains addax , oryx and related species ) and Reduncinae ( which includes reedbuck and kob antelopes ) . Additionally, there are three extinct subfamilies that are known from the fossil record: <unk> ( which existed in the mid-Miocene ) , <unk> ( which lived in the <unk> epoch ) and the subfamily <unk> , which had one member, <unk> ( also from the mid-Miocene ) .",

The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.",
      "Right": "In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.",
      "Passage": "Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species."

Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.",
      "Outcome2": "Moreover, human beings are still struggling with many pressing issues that threaten their well-being and survival. For example, according to the World Food Programme, about 690 million people suffer from hunger and 10,000 children die of malnutrition every day. Similarly, the World Health Organization reports that more than one billion people lack access to basic health services and millions die of preventable diseases each year. In addition, wars and conflicts have displaced over 80 million people and caused untold human suffering and loss. Compared to these human tragedies, the extinction of some animals seems less significant and it is not reasonable to allocate our scarce resources to save them. We should prioritize our own needs and challenges before we worry about the fate of other species.",
      "Outcome3": "Also, we humans have a lot of big problems to deal with right now, like hunger, sickness and fighting. These problems are more important than some animals dying out that we can't save anyway. It's like trying to fix a broken toy when your house is on fire. We need to take care of ourselves and our needs first before we worry about saving other animals.",
      "Outcome4": "Moreover, humans have more pressing issues like hunger, disease and war. Compared to these, some animal extinctions seem less significant and we cannot waste our scarce resources on hopeless cases. We need to prioritize our own survival and well-being before we worry about other species.",
      "Outcome5": "Also, people have many big problems to deal with like not having enough food, being sick or fighting with each other. When we think about these problems, we don't care so much about some animals going away forever and we can't stop it from happening. We need to use our things and money to help ourselves first before we help other animals. We should take care of ourselves and let nature do what it wants with the animals.",
      "Outcome6": "Moreover, from an evolutionary perspective, species extinction is a natural and inevitable phenomenon that has occurred throughout the history of life on Earth. The Earth's environment has undergone drastic changes since the origin of life, and many plants and animals have failed to adapt to these changes and perished. In most cases, the extinction of some species is irreversible and beyond human intervention. Therefore, it is not a wise or realistic choice to allocate our scarce resources to saving animals that are doomed to disappear. We should prioritize our own survival and well-being as human beings before we worry about the preservation of other species.",

Following the season , Ray Perkins resigned as head coach to take over the same position at the University of Alabama , and was replaced by the team 's defensive coordinator Bill Parcells . In the coming years this change would prove crucial to the Giants and Simms .",
      "Right": "During his first few years on the team , Giants fans were merciless in their treatment of Simms , who they felt was a disappointment . He commented that his wife \" had to sit up in the stands and listen to them cuss me . \" However , in 1984 , after many seasons plagued by injuries and up-and-down play , Simms finally emerged as a team offensive leader . During his 1983 injury , offensive coordinator Ron Erhardt talked Simms into watching more game film , something he had not regularly done in college or the pros . He gained a better understanding of NFL defenses , his team 's formations , and pass protection schemes , and improved his ability to audible at the line of scrimmage . He also changed his strength training regimen in an attempt to make his body more resistant to injury . He passed for 4,044 yards ( second most in the National Football Conference ( NFC ) ) , 22 touchdown passes , and led the Giants to a playoff berth .\n He was voted to the Pro Bowl and named Pro Bowl MVP as he led the NFC to a comeback win over the American Football Conference ( AFC ) by throwing three touchdowns . In 1985 , he passed for 3,829 yards , 22 touchdowns , and led the Giants to 10 victories , the most for a Giants team since 1963 . In a game against the Cincinnati Bengals during the 1985 season , Simms passed for 513 yards — the fifth most passing yards in a single game in NFL history . In 1986 , he passed for 3,487 yards and 21 touchdown passes during a season in which the Giants won 14 games . In week 11 , he completed a desperate fourth-and-17 pass to Bobby Johnson late in the game to set up Raul Allegre 's game-winning field goal , which gave the Giants a 22 – 20 victory over the Minnesota Vikings . Simms later commented : \n It 's my favorite game in my career , because it 's everything I always wanted to be as a player . I wanted to be tough , making big throws , immune to pressure , not worried about outcomes . It was truly like standing on the tee box in golf and there 's trees on each side and water and you just go ' Man , I 'm gonna rip it down the middle . ' And no other thought crosses your mind .",
      "Passage": "One of Parcells first decisions as coach was to replace Simms as the starting quarterback with Brunner . Simms asked to be traded after the benching , but his request was ignored . During the sixth game of the Giants ' 1983 Season , Simms came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the Philadelphia Eagles . On his second drive , Simms suffered a season-ending injury when the thumb on his throwing hand hit a player 's helmet on his follow-through . The injury was reported as a dislocation , but according to the book , Simms to McConkey , written by Phil McConkey , Simms , and Dick Schaap , the injury was much more severe , with the thumb literally hanging off after impact , and the bone sticking out through the skin ."

      "Outcome0": "",
      "Outcome1": "Simms did not play well for four years because he got hurt a lot and did not throw the ball well . He hurt his shoulder in one game and his team did better without him . Then he hurt his knee before another season and did not play at all . His coach left and a new coach came . The new coach did not want Simms to play and Simms was angry . But when Simms got to play again , he hurt his thumb very badly on his hand that throws the ball . He could not play for the rest of the season .",
      "Outcome2": "One of Parcells first decisions as coach was to replace Simms as the starting quarterback with Brunner . Simms felt betrayed by the move and asked to be traded after the benching , but his request was ignored . During the sixth game of the Giants ' 1983 Season , Simms got a chance to prove himself when he came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the Philadelphia Eagles . However , his comeback was cut short when he suffered a season-ending injury on his second drive . The thumb on his throwing hand hit a player 's helmet on his follow-through and was severely damaged , requiring surgery and months of rehabilitation . The injury not only ended his hopes of regaining his starting job , but also alienated him further from Parcells and the fans , who questioned his durability and toughness .",
      "Outcome3": "Parcells benched Simms in favor of Brunner as his first move as coach . Simms wanted a trade , but got no response . He replaced Brunner in the sixth game of 1983 against the Eagles , but injured his thumb on his throwing hand and missed the rest of the season . The injury was worse than a dislocation , as Simms ' thumb hung off and the bone pierced the skin .",
      "Outcome4": "Simms faced injuries and poor performance for four years . He had 15 touchdowns and 19 interceptions in 1980 , and a separated shoulder in 1981 that sidelined him for the playoffs . He missed the entire 1982 season with a torn knee ligament . Ray Perkins left as head coach and Bill Parcells took over . Parcells benched Simms for Scott Brunner , and Simms wanted a trade . He returned in 1983 , but hurt his thumb badly in his second game and was out for the year .",
      "Outcome5": "Simms had to sit on the bench and watch another player be the quarterback , because he hurt his thumb very badly when he threw the ball and hit someone 's helmet . His thumb was so bad that it came off his hand and he had to go to the hospital . He was very sad and wanted to play for another team , but they did not let him .",
      "Outcome6": "However, Simms faced more challenges in his next four seasons, as he dealt with various injuries and inconsistent play. He ended the 1980 season with a disappointing record of 15 touchdowns and 19 interceptions, while completing only 48.0 % of his passes for 2,321 yards. The following year, he showed some improvement by throwing for 2,031 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions on a 54.4 % completion percentage, but he suffered a separated shoulder in a November 15 loss to the Washington Redskins that sidelined him for the rest of the season. Without Simms, the Giants rallied behind Scott Brunner and made it to the second round of the playoffs. Simms' bad luck continued in 1982, when he tore a knee ligament in a preseason game against the New York Jets, forcing him to miss the entire season. After the season, Ray Perkins resigned as head coach to take over the same position at the University of Alabama. He was replaced by Bill Parcells, who was the team's defensive coordinator at the time. This coaching change would prove to be a turning point for both the Giants and Simms in the years to come. One of Parcells' first decisions as coach was to bench Simms and start Brunner at quarterback instead. Simms was unhappy with this move and asked to be traded, but his request was ignored by the team management. During the sixth game of the Giants' 1983 Season, Simms got a chance to play again when he replaced Brunner who was struggling against the Philadelphia Eagles. However, his comeback was short-lived as he sustained another season-ending injury on his second drive. He hit his thumb on his throwing hand on a player's helmet on his follow-through and severely damaged it. The injury was reported as a dislocation by the media, but according to Simms' account in his book Simms to McConkey co-written with Phil McConkey and Dick Schaap , it was much worse than that: his thumb was hanging off after impact and had pierced through his skin.",

      "Left": "An expansion of the metro , the City Circle Line , is under-construction and scheduled to open in 2019 . Independent of the existing system , it will circle the city center and connect the areas of Østerbro , Nørrebro and <unk> to Frederiksberg and Indre By . The line will be 15.5 km ( 9.6 miles ) long and run entirely in tunnel . The circle will have 17 stations , two of which are interchanges with both the M1 and M2 lines , and it will take 25 minutes to complete a full circle . Archaeological and geological surveys started in 2007 , preferred bidders were announced in November 2010 and contracts were signed in 2011 . Preparations began by moving utilities etc. in 2010 , and construction of work sites and stations began in 2011 . Drilling of tunnels will begin in 2013 . On 7 January 2011 the new project called <unk> started with the signature by Metroselskabet of new contracts , with Ansaldo Breda and Ansaldo Sts ( Finmeccanica Group ) for the supply of trains and control systems and with an Italian joint-venture led by <unk> <unk> ( about 60 % ) and <unk> ( about 40 % ) with <unk> as third partner for the construction part . In July 2013 , <unk> og <unk> , the environmental appeals board , ruled that the city was wrong to grant Metroselskabet <unk> for 24-hour work days and noise up to 78 db at the <unk> site . The company is now required to stop work 6PM until a final ruling is made , which could take up to half a year , potentially delaying the completion date .",
      "Right": "A northwestern expansion of the City Circle Line was planned , where M4 would divert at Nørrebro and run to the suburbs of Brønshøj and Gladsaxe . This project was abandoned , as the interchange chamber between any such line and the City Circle Line was scrapped as part of the City of Copenhagen 's 2009 budget . In subsequent plans , the northern extension of the M4 has instead been relocated as a Nordhavn branch which will connect with the City Circle Line at Østerport . A Nordhavn line with two stations has been approved by the Danish parliament , and is planned to open in 2019 . The southern extension of the M4 will run from Copenhagen Central Station through Sydhavn to Ny Ellebjerg , where the M4 will link up with the S-train and regional train system . The Danish Transport Authority ( <unk> ) has suggested to convert the F-line of the S-train network to metro standard as an M5 line , but as the only linkup between the M5 and the existing network would be at <unk> Station ( interchange with M1 and M2 ) , this plan is dependent on the approval of a southern extension of the M4 , also providing the M5 with an interchange with the M4 at Ny Ellebjerg Station .\n The City of Copenhagen has suggested two additional lines M6 and M7 , and a western extension of the M1 or M2 to <unk> has also been suggested .\n In September 2011 , the local governments in Copenhagen and neighbouring Malmö in Sweden announced that they were seeking European Union funding to study a potential metro line under the Øresund to the neighbourhood of Malmö Central Station , providing faster trips and additional capacity beyond that of the existing Øresund Bridge . The study , for which the EU granted funding in the following December , will consider both a simple shuttle between the two stations and a continuous line integrated with the local transport networks on each side , and they anticipate a travel time of 15 minutes between the two city centers .",
      "Passage": "The line will operate as M3 and M4 . The former will run a full circle , while M4 will only operate on the eastern half from Copenhagen Central Station ( <unk> H ) via Østerport to Nørrebro . This solution is temporary , once the metro network has been extended to Nordhavn , the M4 will start at Copenhagen Central Station but leave the City Circle Line at Østerport and service the Nordhavn branch . Later , when the Sydhavn extension has been completed , the M4 will have Ny Ellebjerg as its southern terminus . Trains will operate both ways through the circle . The line will have transfer to M1 and M2 at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv . The line is estimated to carry 240,000 daily passengers , bringing the metro 's total daily ridership to 460,000 ."

The Linos Ensemble is constantly accorded such attributes, and this is not just the result of intensive and enthusiastic rehearsals, but has other reasons as well. They include the experience of joint work on interpretation, which is always pions in music. The Neueste Nachrichten in Dresden wrote: 'It was an exquisite concert the Linos Ensemble gave us. Its name, which derives from Greek mythology, is explained by the title: Linos, the god of rhythm and melody. After what we have heard, we can add: also the god of immense creative power and differentiation of colour'.",
      "Right": "What the critics say\nAnd the members of the Linos Ensemble, whose mandate is to seek out and record chamber works of lesser known composers, like this recent recording of chamber music by Arnold Krug, are so well matched that they generate a much beefier and ample sound, and commited playing, than their crew of eleven would suggest. An essential compilation for any serious collector offered at a bargain price.\n Winfried Rademacher, a student of Josef Suk, plays with tonal sweetness and technical security. He plays the lyric sections in particular with distinction, and marshals that fearsome first movement cadenza with sang froid. The almost religioso element of the opening of the Largo comes over with a particularly intimate refinement in this chamber arrangement, the Linos Ensemble's thoughtful sonority providing a deft tapestry.\n This homage to Arnold Schoenberg's Association for Private Musical Performances is an undeniable artistic success. pizzicato, 23.10.2017\nBest of all is Ukrainian mezzo Zoryana Kushpler, a comprimario at the Vienna Staatsoper who has sung Carmen at the Volksoper. She has a warm, liquid voice, consistently golden over the wide range of these songs, and from pp to ff.\n A historic recommendation / Een historische aanrader.\n The disc is thus unusual and highly successful - a very significant achievement which I enjoyed greatly.",
      "Passage": "The Linos Ensemble was founded by the oboist Klaus Becker in 1977.\nIn the meantime, the ensemble's repertoire comprises more than 130 works, from Bach to Stockhausen and from the trio to the chamber symphony. The musicians have conquered the CD market with more than 20 excellently reviewed productions, some of which have been awarded prizes such as the recording Louise Farrenc Piano Quintets Nos. 1 and 2, which won the 'Prize of German Record Criticism' 3/94 or the Quintet for Piano left-hand of Franz Schmidt, for which the ensemble received the ECHO Klassik 2017.

Many contemporary writers believed that monarchs should rule in accordance with the custom and the law , with the counsel of the leading members of the realm , but there was no model for what should happen if a king refused to do so .\n John had lost most of his ancestral lands in France to King Philip II in 1204 and had struggled to regain them for many years , raising extensive taxes on the barons to accumulate money to fight a war which ultimately ended in expensive failure in 1214 . Following the defeat of his allies at the Battle of Bouvines , John had to sue for peace and pay compensation . John was already personally unpopular with many of the barons , many of whom owed money to the Crown , and little trust existed between the two sides . A triumph would have strengthened his position , but in the face of his defeat , within a few months after his return from France John found that rebel barons in the north and east of England were organising resistance to his rule .\n The rebels took an oath that they would \" stand fast for the liberty of the church and the realm \" , and demanded that the King confirm the Charter of Liberties that had been declared by King Henry I in the previous century , and which was perceived by the barons to protect their rights . The rebel leadership was unimpressive by the standards of the time , even disreputable , but were united by their hatred of John ; Robert FitzWalter , later elected leader of the rebel barons , claimed publicly that John had attempted to rape his daughter , and was implicated in a plot to assassinate John in 1212 .\n John held a council in London in January 1215 to discuss potential reforms , and sponsored discussions in Oxford between his agents and the rebels during the spring . Both sides appealed to Pope Innocent III for assistance in the dispute . During the negotiations , the rebellious barons produced an initial document , which historians have termed \" the Unknown Charter of Liberties \" , which drew on Henry I 's Charter of Liberties for much of its language ; seven articles from that document later appeared in the \" Articles of the Barons \" and the subsequent charter .",
      "Right": "Letters backing John arrived from the Pope in April , but by then , the rebel barons had organised into a military faction . They congregated at Northampton in May and renounced their feudal ties to John , marching on London , Lincoln , and Exeter . John 's efforts to appear moderate and conciliatory had been largely successful , but once the rebels held London , they attracted a fresh wave of defectors from the royalists . The King offered to submit the problem to a committee of arbitration with the Pope as the supreme arbiter , but this was not attractive to the rebels . Stephen Langton , the Archbishop of Canterbury , had been working with the rebel barons on their demands , and after the suggestion of papal arbitration failed , John instructed Langton to organise peace talks .",
      "Passage": "It was John 's hope that the Pope would give him valuable legal and moral support , and accordingly John played for time ; the King had declared himself to be a papal vassal in 1213 and correctly believed he could count on the Pope for help . John also began recruiting mercenary forces from France , although some were later sent back to avoid giving the impression that the King was escalating the conflict . In a further move to shore up his support , John took an oath to become a crusader , a move which gave him additional political protection under church law , even though many felt the promise was insincere ."

The King had sworn fealty to the Pope in 1213 and rightly assumed he could rely on the Pope's backing. John also hired mercenary troops from France, although some were later dismissed to avoid looking like he was fanning the flames of war. In a further attempt to bolster his position, John pledged to join a crusade, a move which gave him extra legal and moral protection under church law, even though many doubted his sincerity.",
      "Outcome2": "As John tried to gain the Pope's support and stall the negotiations with the rebels, he also prepared for a possible war by hiring mercenaries and taking a crusader's oath.

      "Outcome3": "John hoped that the Pope would help him and say he was right, so he tried to delay things. He had given himself to the Pope in 1213 and thought the Pope would be on his side. John also hired soldiers from France, but he sent some back because he did not want to look like he was starting a fight. He also said he would go on a holy war, which made him safer under the church's rules, but many people did not believe him.",

      "Outcome5": "John wanted the big boss of the church, called the Pope, to help him and say he was right. John tried to wait and see what the Pope would say. John also brought some friends from another country to fight for him, but he sent some of them back because he did not want to look too mean. John also said he would go on a big trip to help the church, but many people did not believe him.",
      "Outcome6": "John 's strategy was to rely on the Pope for support in his dispute with the barons , and he tried to delay the negotiations as much as possible . He had given up his rights as a king to the Pope in 1213 , and he expected that the Pope would favour him over the rebels . John also hired mercenaries from France to strengthen his military position , but he later dismissed some of them to avoid provoking the barons further . Another tactic that John used was to take a vow to join the crusade , which was supposed to grant him some protection from excommunication and interdict under the church law , although many people doubted his sincerity .",

Steps were taken to divert men from Communications Zone units . The commander of the Communication Zone , Lieutenant General John C. H. Lee , persuaded Eisenhower to allow soldiers to volunteer for service \" without regard to color or race to the units where assistance is most needed , and give you the opportunity of fighting shoulder to shoulder to bring about victory \" .\n Smith immediately grasped the political implications of this . He put his position to Eisenhower in writing : \n Although I am now somewhat out of touch with the War Department 's Negro policy , I did , as you know , handle this during the time I was with General Marshall . Unless there has been a radical change , the sentence which I have marked in the attached circular letter will place the War Department in very grave difficulties . It is inevitable that this statement will get out , and equally inevitable that the result will be that every Negro organization , pressure group and newspaper will take the attitude that , while the War Department segregates colored troops into organizations of their own against the desires and pleas of all the Negro race , the Army is perfectly willing to put them in the front lines mixed in units with white soldiers , and have them do battle when an emergency arises . Two years ago I would have considered the marked statement the most dangerous thing that I had ever seen in regard to Negro relations . I have talked with Lee about it , and he can 't see this at all . He believes that it is right that colored and white soldiers should be mixed in the same company . With this belief I do not argue , but the War Department policy is different . Since I am convinced that this circular letter will have the most serious repercussions in the United States , I believe that it is our duty to draw the War Department 's attention to the fact that this statement has been made , to give them warning as to what may happen and any facts which they may use to counter the pressure which will undoubtedly be placed on them .\n The policy was revised , with Negro soldiers serving in provisional platoons . In the 12th Army Group these were attached to regiments , while in the 6th Army Group the platoons were grouped into whole companies attached to the division . The former arrangement were generally better rated by the units they were attached to , because the Negro platoons had no company-level unit training .",

Once again , Strong acted as an interpreter . Smith took a hard line , threatening that unless terms were accepted , the Allies would seal the front , thus forcing the remaining Germans into the hands of the Red Army , but he made some concessions regarding a ceasefire before the surrender came into effect .

After threatening Seyss-Inquart with prosecution for war crimes , Smith successfully negotiated for the provision of food to the suffering Dutch civilian population in the cities in the west of the country , and he opened discussions for the peaceful and complete German capitulation in the Netherlands , to the First Canadian Army , that did follow on the 5th of May ."

      "Outcome3": "As the war in Europe was drawing to a close , Smith faced another humanitarian challenge : the famine in the Netherlands . The Nazi governor of the country , Arthur Seyss-Inquart , agreed to allow food and coal shipments to the starving population of Amsterdam on 15 April 1945 . Smith led a delegation of Allied representatives to meet with him in the Dutch village of <unk> on 30 April . He used his diplomatic skills to pressure Seyss-Inquart into accepting the Allied terms for relief and surrender . He also initiated talks for the complete German capitulation in the Netherlands , which was achieved by the First Canadian Army on 5 May .",
      "Outcome4": "On 15 April 1945 , Smith and other Allied representatives met with the Nazi governor of the Netherlands , Arthur Seyss-Inquart , in <unk> . They pressured him to allow food and coal shipments to the starving Dutch civilians and to surrender peacefully to the First Canadian Army . The surrender was completed on May 5 .",
      "Outcome5": "Some bad people were hurting the people who lived in a big city called Amsterdam . They did not let them have enough food or heat . Smith and some other good people talked to the bad people and told them to stop being mean . They said they would punish them if they did not listen . The bad people agreed to let the good people bring food and heat to the city . Smith also helped the good people make peace with the bad people in another place , so they would not fight anymore . He made them sign a paper that said they would stop fighting .",
      "Outcome6": "On 15 April 1945 , the Nazi governor ( Reichskommissar ) of the Netherlands , Arthur Seyss-Inquart , made a surprising offer to the Allies . He proposed to open up Amsterdam and other cities in the west of the country to food and coal shipments from the Allies , in order to alleviate the dire situation of the civilian population , who were starving and freezing under the German occupation . Smith and Strong , as representatives of SHAEF , were sent to negotiate with Seyss-Inquart in a Dutch village called <unk> on 30 April . They were joined by Major General Ivan Susloparov from the Soviet Union , Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld from the Dutch government in exile , and Major General Sir Francis de Guingand from 21st Army Group . Smith did not trust Seyss-Inquart 's motives and threatened him with prosecution for war crimes if he did not cooperate with the Allies . Smith managed to secure an agreement for the delivery of food to the Dutch civilians by air and land , and he also initiated discussions for the peaceful and complete surrender of all German forces in the Netherlands , which was under the command of the First Canadian Army . The surrender was finalized on May 5th.",

      "Left": "The role of the offensive unit is to advance the football down the field with the ultimate goal of scoring a touchdown .\n The offensive team must line up in a legal formation before they can snap the ball . An offensive formation is considered illegal if there are more than four players in the backfield or fewer than five players numbered 50-79 on the offensive line . Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee , who then informs the defensive team of the change . Neither team 's players , with the exception of the snapper , are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped . Interior offensive linemen are not allowed to move until the snap of the ball .\n The main backfield positions are the quarterback ( QB ) , halfback / tailback ( HB / TB ) and fullback ( FB ) . The quarterback is the leader of the offense . Either he or a coach calls the plays . Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the huddle before the team lines up . The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off , throws it or runs with it .\n The primary role of the halfback , also known as the tailback , is to carry the ball on running plays . Halfbacks may also serve as receivers . Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and function primarily as blockers , but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage situations and often are not used in passing situations .",

Tight ends line up outside of the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers .",

      "Left": "The implementation of these retrogressive policies, function to impede the overall economic and social welfare of the Palestinians. It needs to be noted that the retrogressive policies being referenced herein entails the restriction of movement coupled by the bombings being undertaken by the Israelites.\n Given the policy approach adopted by the Israelites, it becomes possible to comprehend the rationale for the breakdown of the relationships. As has been reiterated herein, the core mandate of the EU is to ensure that governments behave in a manner that does not impede the economic and social welfare of the people. It meets this mandate by leveraging its market power to compel the adoption of effective policies. Such a value affirms the value of the relationship with the EU. However, Israel is jeopardizing this trading relationship by engaging in flawed and retrogressive political policies. Such is the understanding that has driven the breakdown the relationship between Israel and the E.U. To some degree, the same situation is exhibited in the case of Ukraine.\n The relationship between Ukraine and the EU has been strained primarily by the changes in the political and social environment. In the case of Ukraine, the government had embraced some aspects of radicalization (Astrov, 2010). Aside from this, there is also aspect of misuse of the security forces. While it is understandable that the change in the political environment, the approach employed by the government ought to have implemented effective counter measures. However, the government has adopted a negative approach to dealing with this change. It is with this understanding that the change in the relationship between the EU and the country can be explained by the change in tact in dealing with the adverse change in the political climate. To some degree, there is a convergence between the rationale for the break-down of the relationship with both Ukraine and Israel and the EU.\n In the case of both the Ukraine and Israel, the break-down of the relationship hinges on the change in the political environment. For Israel, the government employed political measures as a means of mitigating the level of threat sourced from the Palestine. In so doing, the government impeded on the quality of the relationship with the EU. Essentially, the nation should have identified a means of addressing the security risk emanating from the Palestinians in an ethical manner. On the other hand, in the case of the Ukraine, the government should have identified a different means addressing the political conditions characterising the land. To some degree, there is a convergence between the approach employed by both Israel and Ukraine.",
      "Right": "The principle of more and more hinges on explaining the regulatory approach employed by the EU as a means of safeguarding the welfare of the people. As has been reiterated herein, the EU affects its regulatory powers by employing economic and social policies. In this way, the EU can control the effects of detrimental and flawed political, social and economic policies. Therefore, the more for more principle then functions as a means of ensuring that the EU can indeed control the policies implemented by governments across the world. In the case of the Ukraine and Israel, the EU employs the more for principle to enable the two nations to adhere to the set code of conduct as it pertains to political, social and economic welfare. In the case of the Ukraine, there is an increase in the overall degree of funding from the E.U. In the year 2014, the E.U spent about EUR 1.2 billion. On the other hand, the E.U spent about EUR 4.4 billion. Such a trend demonstrates the move by the E.U to compel a change in the change in policies implemented by the Ukrainian government.\n In the case of Israel, there has been an increase in funding which has reached its maximum point in the year 2016 at a value of EUR 4.8 billion. However, it needs to be noted that the recent onslaught of attacks against the Palestinians has impeded the overall quality of the relationship between the EU and Israel. Essentially, Israel has destroyed EU's investment of about EUR 76 million. It is then apparent why there has been a deterioration of the relationship.\n Both nations are experiencing a decline in their democracy scores with Ukraine recording the highest rate of decline. Essentially, with reference to democracy, Ukraine has tended to impede on the overall welfare of its own citizens. On the other hand, Israel tends to impede the welfare of Palestinians. With reference to human rights, Israel has recorded a large rate of decline in its human rights scores. While Ukraine has engaged in flawed political policies, it has yet to engage in the contravention of human rights.\n Main problematic aspects of the EU relations with Ukraine and Israel\nRussia will keep on exerting weight on Ukraine with the end goal of including the nation into the post-Soviet joining structures. The present legislature of the Russian Federation comprehends: an effective incorporation of Ukraine into the EU, from one viewpoint, gives a contrasting option to Russia's \"oversaw majority rules system.\"",
      "Passage": "The convergence between the approaches employed by both Ukraine and Israel tends to demonstrate that overall weaknesses of the regulatory capacity characterising the EU. In essence, an effective regulatory approach employed by the EU would have mitigated the potential for a decline in the political relationships between the pertinent countries. The fact that there was a decline in the relationships between the EU and both Israel and the Ukraine denotes the need for a revision to the model employed by the EU. In this way, it will become plausible to safeguard the welfare of the people in the future. The EU needs to leverage its power."

The convergence between the approaches employed by both Ukraine and Israel tends to demonstrate that overall weaknesses of the regulatory capacity characterising the EU.

In this way, it will become plausible to safeguard the welfare of the people in the future. The EU needs to leverage its power.",
      "Outcome2": "Both Ukraine and Israel have adopted similar strategies in response to the changes in their political environment. For Israel, the government resorted to political measures as a way of reducing the threat posed by the Palestinians. However, by doing so, the government harmed its relationship with the EU. Essentially, the nation should have sought a more humane and peaceful way of addressing the security risk stemming from the Palestinians. On the other hand, in the case of Ukraine, the government should have pursued a different way of dealing with the political turmoil in the country. Thus, there is a parallel between the strategies used by both Israel and Ukraine.",
      "Outcome3": "Both Ukraine and Israel have used similar approaches to deal with changes in their political situations. These approaches have harmed their relationships with the EU. The EU tries to regulate the policies of its partners by using its economic and social power. But the EU failed to prevent the decline of the political ties with both countries. This shows that the EU needs to improve its regulatory model. The EU should use its power more effectively.",
      "Outcome4": "Both Ukraine and Israel have adopted similar political strategies that have strained their relations with the EU. The EU's regulatory power has failed to prevent the deterioration of these relations, which suggests a need for a revised model. The EU uses its economic leverage to influence the policies of both countries.",
      "Outcome5": "Some countries do bad things to other people or to their own people. The EU is a big group of countries that tries to stop them from doing bad things. The EU can give them money or trade with them if they do good things, or take away money or trade if they do bad things. This is how the EU helps people live better and safer. But sometimes the EU cannot stop some countries from doing bad things, and then the EU gets angry and sad. Both Ukraine and Israel have done some bad things, and the EU tried to make them stop, but they did not listen.",
      "Outcome6": "One possible implication of the divergence in the approaches employed by both Ukraine and Israel is that it reveals the limitations of the EU's regulatory capacity. In other words, a more effective regulatory framework by the EU could have prevented or reduced the deterioration of the political relations between the concerned countries. Therefore, this suggests that the EU needs to review and revise its model of influencing and monitoring the policies implemented by governments across the world. By doing so, it will be able to better protect and promote the welfare of the people in the future. The EU has to use its power more assertively.",

With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.",

If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity.

When a firm adopts environmentally friendly practices, it has to optimize its use of resources and upgrade its production lines and equipment.

Conversely, if a firm neglects the environmental impact of its operations, it will waste a lot of energy and incur high operational costs, which will hamper its economic development.",

If a firm adopts green practices, it may have to optimize its resource allocation and upgrade its production facilities, which can increase output. Therefore, it may foster its economic growth.

      "Outcome4": "Moreover, environmental care can improve work efficiency. Firms that respect the environment use their resources wisely to upgrade their production and equipment, which increases productivity and economic growth. Conversely, firms that ignore the environment waste a lot of energy and incur high operational costs, which hinder economic development.",
      "Outcome5": "Also, caring about the environment can help us work better. If a company wants to be nice to the environment, it has to use less things and make them work better, which can help them make more things. So they can grow and make more money. But if a company does not care about the environment, it will use too many things and waste them, which can cost them a lot of money and make it hard for them to grow.",

When a firm adopts an eco-friendly approach, it may have to optimize its resource allocation and upgrade its production facilities and methods, which can result in higher efficiency and quality. Consequently, it may foster its economic growth. By contrast, without paying attention to the environmental preservation, the firm would continue to waste a large amount of energy that could otherwise be saved or invested, hindering its economic development.",

In the course of undertaking their professional duties, mandated staff members are required to report their belief, when the belief is formed on reasonable grounds, that a child is in need of protection from significant harm as a result of sexual abuse or physical injury.\n School policy and procedures stipulate how teaching staff fulfil their duty of care towards children and young people in their school.\n Teachers are encouraged to discuss any concerns about the safety and wellbeing of students with the principal or a member of the school leadership team. If a principal or member of the leadership team does not wish to make a mandatory report, this does not discharge the teacher's obligation to do so if they have formed a reasonable belief that abuse may have occurred.

Therefore, if the university hires 500 faculty and staff, it will also support 750 other jobs in various sectors. Additionally, the university will increase the purchasing power of the community, as people who work or study there will spend money on local businesses such as restaurants, shops, and entertainment.

Additionally, the university will attract more students and visitors, who will also contribute to the local economy by spending on accommodation, transportation, food, and entertainment.\n\nHowever, the new university may also bring some negative effects to the community. One of them is that it may increase the population density and cause some social problems. Many people from other places may move to the community to study or work at the university, putting pressure on the existing infrastructure and resources. This may result in more traffic congestion, environmental pollution, waste management issues, and crime. These problems may affect the well-being and safety of the residents and reduce their quality of life.",

      "Left": "Inspired by the aesthetics of the very first hot air balloons, Hot Balloon is an elegant contrast of visible mechanical parts and a metal parts in a variety of finishes and refined decorations.\n Every component of the mechanical clock is designed to resemble the parts of a hot air balloon: turning the basket winds the movement; the burners serve as the escapement; the flame indicates the hour and minutes; and finally, the envelope (the balloon), with its wide openings, lends the piece an imposing transparent, airy aspect.\n Hot Balloon can be displayed on a desk, a table or a shelf, and it can also be hung directly from the ceiling, floating in air above it all - a first for a mechanical clock of this scale.\n Hot Balloon is therefore be supplied with a suspension kit. A very thin cable, fully incorporated into the clock's design, attaches to the hot air balloon, allowing it to take flight.\n The time is displayed on the balloon's burner; a two-pointed needle resembling a flame indicates the hours and minutes on two black cylinders stacked one on top of the other.\n The crown for setting the time is located under the vertical escapement, and its gear train is located between the basket and burner, in place of the blast valve. Just as the flow of gas inflating the hot air balloon is adjusted with the blast valve, the clock's time is adjusted with this crown.\n Winding the clock involves the whole basket. Regardless of how Hot Balloon is displayed, to wind the clock, simply turn the base several times (generally six turns), to provide enough power for eight days of flight.\n To give the design an airy feel, while providing excellent stability, the balloon, which measures seventeen centimeters in diameter, was conceived as a hollow element, so as to allow light to pass through it. Incorporating complex, curved lines into the design was not insignificant for designer Margo Clavier. It is, however, a choice that demanded more from the engineers and machinists, since many hours of turning and machining are required to create this piece. A block of material had to be turned and machined to hollow out the balloon before creating its pockets and curves. The balloon is formed from one single piece, and a vast one in comparison to typical dimensions of watchmaking.",

Early on, science identified the Archimedes principle, which although more commonly applied to liquids, can also be applied to gases. Drawing upon this principle of fluid mechanics, we can imagine an enormous balloon capable of lifting people up into the air. A bit of genius, and undoubtedly a significant element of folly, allowed the first hot air balloon to take off in the late 18th century, ready to fulfill the ambition and dream of exploring the skies.\n The hot air balloon inspired numerous writers, philosophers, filmmakers and adventurers.

The people can make the balloon go up or down by making fire under the balloon. The fire makes the air inside the balloon warmer, and warmer air is lighter than colder air, so it can float in the sky.\n\nHot Balloon is a special kind of clock that looks like a hot air balloon. It has many metal parts that work together to tell you what time it is. You can see how they move and make sounds when you look at them from different angles. The fire under the balloon shows you the hour and minute on two black circles. The small box under the balloon is where you can make the clock work by turning it around. The clock can run for eight days without stopping.\n\nYou can put Hot Balloon on your desk, your table or your shelf, or you can hang it from the ceiling like a real hot air balloon. It has a thin wire that connects to the top of the balloon and lets it fly in your room. It is very beautiful and fun to watch.\n\nHot Balloon was made by a very talented person who likes to design things that are both useful and pretty. She used a lot of skills and tools to make Hot Balloon from one big piece of metal, and then she painted it with different colors. She made only 50 clocks for each color, so they are very rare and special.",
      "Outcome6": "Hot Balloon's basket is not only a decorative element, but also a functional part of the mechanical movement. The design of the movement follows the principles of watchmaking, but on a larger scale. The two upper parts of the basket act as the plate and the bridges of a watch's movement, holding together the main components. The second level is the main plate, which has multiple layers and openings. The barrel and its gear trains are visible from the bottom of the basket through a mineral glass window.\n\nThis clever integration of form and function is a distinctive feature of the brand.",

      "Left": "LSD used 72 scintillation counters in total, whereas the LVD measurement used the data from 304 counters. Only data from inner counters with smaller background rate were analysed in the search for muon-induced neutrons in both experiments. Each counter contained about 1.2 tonnes of liquid scintillator. Both experiments recorded pulses from neutron capture in delayed coincidences with muon triggers. Due to a much higher detection efficiency for neutrons in those counters which also contained a muon track or muon-induced cascade, only pulses detected in the same counter as the muon pulse were analysed. The energy threshold for neutron detection was set at about 0.5-1 MeV. Muon trigger conditions were different: LSD triggered directly on the liquid scintillator signal, requiring either a high energy deposition in one counter (greater than 25 MeV) or a time coincidence between at least two scintillators; LVD required a trigger from an independent tracking system as well. Their tracking information came from a set of limited-streamer tubes positioned on one side and beneath each counter. '\n 'In both experiments the calibration of the detectors was done using neutron sources, with the neutron detection efficiency determined from comparing the resulting data to a simple Monte Carlo for these neutrons. A fit to the measured time delay distribution of neutron capture pulses with respect to the muon trigger consisted of a single exponential plus a flat background. The background was estimated from a separate sample of delayed pulses in counters which were not intersected by muons. Note that this sample of pulses also included a small fraction of neutron captures, since neutrons can be detected at large distances from a muon track and hence in the counters without a muon. Note also that the time distribution of neutron captures can be fitted by a single exponential only if neutron production, moderation, and capture occur within the same material, assumed here to be scintillator. Later simulation work proved that this assumption was wrong; see section on new measurements with LVD. '\n 'The mean energy was calculated to be 270 GeV for LVD and 380 GeV for LSD. Nn is the number of detected neutron captures for the infinite time window after the muon trigger, and was obtained from the fit to the measured distribution with a single exponential and a flat background. '",
      "Right": "'Thus, no direct comparison could be made between measured and simulated neutron capture event rate. '\n'The results were quoted for scintillator, whereas it has since been shown by LVD that most of detected neutrons were produced in iron. This should also be true for LSD, although no simulations have been performed. Hence the factor Q has a large uncertainty factor, which was not been taken into account in the reported results. '\n'However, we now know that the muon-induced neutrons were produced mainly outside the scintillator in iron, and have higher energies than the source neutrons. This most likely resulted in an overestimate of the calculated neutron detection efficiency in both experiments. '\n'Thus, the fraction of detected neutrons is much smaller and their energy somewhat higher since the detected neutrons have travelled further from their production point to their capture point. In conclusion, we believe that the old data from the LSD and LVD experiments, when properly interpreted, do provide a good test of the muon-induced neutron production, but their systematic uncertainties were underestimated. In the absence of full simulation, it is impossible to directly compare the measured and simulated rates of neutron capture pulses within a certain energy range and time window after the muon trigger, which could have provided a crucial test of the model. The LVD also reported the energy spectra of neutron-induced events and the distribution of neutron capture pulses as a function of the distance from the muon track. While this information is important for understanding the emission of neutrons and their transport, it again cannot be properly interpreted without full neutron production/transport Monte Carlo.

New Measurements of muon-induced neutrons with LVD at LNGS\nThe LVD experiment consists of 735 liquid scintillator counters arranged in three towers.

      "Passage": "'This obvious difference between two results which were obtained for the same type of scintillator set up and a similar depth remained a concern for many years in the field and resulted in large uncertainties being attributed to background estimates based on cosmogenic simulations. In addition, new results from LVD showed a significantly bigger value than earlier LVD results (by about 2 standard deviations) and smaller than the early LSD result (also by about 2 standard deviation, although mean muon energy at LSD is higher than at LVD).

To understand these inconsistencies better, we need to examine carefully the experimental details and simulation limitations. In summary:",

      "Outcome3": "One of the main sources of discrepancy between the two results is the factor Q, which is defined as the ratio of the neutron yield in scintillator to that in standard rock. This factor was used to convert the measured neutron rates in scintillator to those expected in rock, which is relevant for underground experiments using rock detectors or shielding. The value of Q was assumed to be 0.7 for both LSD and LVD, based on a theoretical calculation by Zatsepin et al. However, this value has a large uncertainty due to the lack of experimental data and the dependence on the neutron energy spectrum and production mechanism. Therefore, using Q to compare the measurements with simulations or other experiments introduces a significant systematic error.",
      "Outcome4": "These results, obtained with similar scintillator set ups at comparable depths, differed significantly and caused large uncertainties in background estimates from cosmogenic simulations.

      "Outcome5": "So, two groups of people did some experiments to see how many tiny balls of light are made when very fast and heavy raindrops hit the big metal boxes filled with a special liquid. They used machines that could count the balls of light and tell when they were made. They also used machines that could track the raindrops and see how fast and where they went. But the two groups got different answers, even though they used similar boxes and liquids and were under a big mountain that stopped most of the rain. This made them and other people confused and worried for a long time. They also did not know how to compare their answers with what a computer guessed would happen. We looked more carefully at what they did and found some mistakes they made. To fix those mistakes, we need to understand better how the raindrops make the balls of light in different materials and how the balls of light move around before they are counted.",

These experiments used similar detector setups and operated at comparable depths underground, but they reported significantly different values for the number of neutrons per muon. This raised questions about the reliability of the background estimates based on cosmogenic simulations for neutrino experiments that use liquid scintillator as a target or a veto. Moreover, the LVD experiment later published new results that showed a higher neutron production rate than their previous measurement, which reduced but did not eliminate the gap with the LSD result. In order to understand these inconsistencies better, we need to examine the details of the experimental methods and the limitations of the simulations that were used to interpret the data.

Another source of surface water is the inner basin of the San Francisco Peaks, where springs are tapped and piped to the city. This source provides about 2 MGD of high-quality water, but it is only available from May to October. To supplement these sources, the city also relies on groundwater from several wells throughout the area.

The plant also receives water from the inner basin of the San Francisco Peaks, where several springs are located. These springs are fed by snowmelt and rainwater that percolate through the volcanic rock of the mountains. In addition to surface water and springs, Flagstaff also relies on groundwater from wells that tap into the regional aquifer. The wells are distributed throughout the city and its vicinity, and provide backup and supplemental water supply.

There are currently no approved targeted therapies for TKI-pretreated ROS1-positive NSCLC patients.\n- Ongoing progress in the Phase 1 study of TPX-0022, Turning Point's MET/CSF1R/SRC inhibitor; and Phase 1/2 study of TPX-0046, Turning Point's RET/SRC inhibitor trial. For TPX-0046, the company previously announced that enrollment had also included RET-positive patients with solvent-front mutations previously treated with other investigational RET inhibitors.\n- Nomination of TPX-0131, a next-generation ALK inhibitor candidate. TPX-0131 has been designed with a compact macrocyclic structure and in preclinical studies has been shown to potently inhibit wildtype ALK and numerous ALK mutations, in particular the clinically observed G1202R solvent-front mutation and G1202R/L1196M compound mutation.\n - Acceptance of three abstracts for presentation at the AACR Annual Meeting, including preclinical repotrectinib combination data and preclinical data for TPX-0131. In light of the postponement of AACR's Annual Meeting, these data are planned for presentation by the company in the second quarter.\n - Naming Siegfried Reich, Ph.D. as executive vice president and chief scientific officer.\n Operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $23.1 million compared to $9.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 and $22.1 million for the third quarter of 2019. The $13.6 million year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased development spend for repotrectinib, TPX-0022 and TPX-0046 as well as personnel expenses that included $4.2 million in non-cash stock-based compensation. Fourth-quarter net cash used in operating activities totaled $14.1 million.",
      "Right": "Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at Dec. 31, 2019 totaled $409.2 million, a decrease of $14.4 million from Sept. 30, 2019. The company continues to project its cash position funds current operations beyond 2021.\n Key milestones anticipated through 2020 include:\n- Presenting preclinical repotrectinib combination data and preclinical data for TPX-0131 in the second quarter.\n- Early interim data from initial patients in some of the registrational cohorts of the repotrectinib TRIDENT-1 Phase 2 study during the second half of the year.\n- Early interim data from initial patients treated with TPX-0022 during the second half of the year.\n- Submitting the IND for TPX-0131 by early 2021.\n Turning Point Therapeutics will not host a Quarterly Update conference call this quarter.\n Turning Point Therapeutics is a clinical-stage precision oncology company with a pipeline of internally discovered investigational drugs designed to address key limitations of existing cancer therapies. The company's lead drug candidate, repotrectinib, is a next-generation kinase inhibitor targeting the ROS1 and TRK oncogenic drivers of non-small cell lung cancer and advanced solid tumors. The company's pipeline of drug candidates also includes TPX-0022, targeting MET, CSF1R and SRC, which is currently being studied in a Phase 1 trial of patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in MET; TPX-0046, targeting RET and SRC, which is currently being studied in a Phase 1/2 trial of patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors harboring genetic alterations in RET; and TPX-0131, a next-generation ALK inhibitor entering IND-enabling studies. Turning Point's next-generation kinase inhibitors are designed to bind to their targets with greater precision and affinity than existing therapies, with a novel, compact structure that has demonstrated an ability to potentially overcome treatment resistance common with other kinase inhibitors. The company is driven to develop therapies that mark a turning point for patients in their cancer treatment.\n Statements contained in this press release regarding matters that are not historical facts are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.",

This significant year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased development spend for repotrectinib, TPX-0022 and TPX-0046 as well as personnel expenses that included $4.2 million in non-cash stock-based compensation. As a result, fourth-quarter net cash used in operating activities totaled $14.1 million.\nFor the year, operating expenses amounted to $77.7 million compared to $25.6 million during 2018, reflecting a more than three-fold rise. The main drivers of this increase were development expenses for repotrectinib, TPX-0022 and TPX-0046 and personnel expenses that included $12.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation. Consequently, net cash used in operating activities reached $57.8 million.",
      "Outcome2": "For the year, operating expenses totaled $77.7 million compared to $25.6 million during 2018. The $52.1 million increase was mainly attributable to the advancement of the company's pipeline of drug candidates, especially repotrectinib, TPX-0022 and TPX-0046. The company invested significantly in the clinical development of repotrectinib, which entered a Phase 2 registrational study in the fourth quarter, as well as in the preclinical and clinical activities for TPX-0022 and TPX-0046, which both initiated first-in-human trials in 2019. In addition, the company incurred higher personnel expenses that included $12.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation. Net cash used in operating activities was $57.8 million.",
      "Outcome3": "Some of the main factors of the increase in operating expenses for the year were:\n\n- Increased development spend for repotrectinib, TPX-0022 and TPX-0046\n- Increased personnel expenses that included $12.7 million in non-cash stock-based compensation\n- Higher operating costs associated with becoming a public company in April 2019",
      "Outcome4": "Operating expenses for 2019 were $77.7 million, up from $25.6 million in 2018, mainly due to higher development and personnel costs that included $12.7 million in stock-based compensation. Operating cash flow was negative $57.8 million.",

Another strategy is to diversify the types of exam tasks to suit different kinds of abilities and learning styles. For instance, multiple-choice questions can assess factual recall and comprehension, while essays can evaluate critical thinking and writing skills. However, exams alone cannot capture the full range of competencies that students need in the 21st century.

For example, assignment writing can evaluate how well candidates can conduct independent research and present their arguments in a structured way, while group projects can measure how effectively they can collaborate with others and solve problems creatively. These types of assessment can also reduce the pressure and anxiety that some test-takers may experience in exam situations. Therefore, a balanced and diversified approach to assessment is preferable to relying solely on exams.",

These additional activities do not alter the oversight or regulatory responsibilities of the board. Therefore, this bill will have no expenditure impact on the general fund, federal funds, or other funds for LLR.\n This bill would require speech-language pathologists and audiologists employed by a political subdivision of the state after January 1, 2019, to obtain a license. Currently, such employees are exempt from licensure requirements and include speech-language pathologists and speech-language pathology therapists employed by local school districts. The Department of Education (SCDE) reports that speech-language pathologists hired by local school districts bill Medicaid for services performed in a school setting. The services may be provided by speech-language pathology assistants, interns, or therapists, but must be supervised by a speech-language pathologist.\n Speech-language pathologists and pathology therapists hired after January 1, 2019, would be required to obtain a license. SCDE indicates that, as a result of this bill, it may be difficult to obtain a sufficient number of licensed pathologists and pathology therapists to provide the current volume of services. Therefore, this may reduce the amount of services billed to Medicaid, which would in turn reduce Medicaid reimbursement expenditures of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). However, because the effect on current school personnel is unknown, the expenditure impact to federal funds is undetermined.\n This bill would require speech-language pathologists and audiologists hired by a state or federal agency after January 1, 2019, to obtain a license. Currently, such employees are exempt from licensure requirements. As a result, this bill will increase the number of licenses issued after January 1, 2019. This bill will not affect state or federal speech-language pathologists employed prior to this date, as they will remain exempt from licensure requirement. While the agency does not anticipate the increase to be significant, LLR is unable to determine the additional number of licensure requests due to this requirement. Therefore, the increase to other funds revenue is undetermined.\n This bill requires any person licensed in a profession that overlaps with the scope of speech-language pathology or audiology to obtain a license under this chapter.",

      "Left": "The earliest keeps were built as part of motte-and-bailey castles from the 10th century onwards – a combination of documentary and archaeological evidence places the first such castle , built at <unk> , in 979 . These castles were initially built by the more powerful lords of Anjou in the late 10th and 11th centuries , in particular Fulk III and his son , Geoffrey II , who built a great number of them between 987 and 1060 . William the Conqueror then introduced this form of castle into England when he invaded in 1066 , and the design spread through south Wales as the Normans expanded up the valleys during the subsequent decades .\n In a motte-and-bailey design , a castle would include a mound called a motte , usually artificially constructed by piling up turf and soil , and a bailey , a lower walled enclosure . A keep and a protective wall would usually be built on top of the motte . Some protective walls around a keep would be large enough to have a wall-walk around them , and the outer walls of the motte and the wall-walk could be strengthened by filling in the gap between the wooden walls with earth and stones , allowing it to carry more weight – this was called a <unk> . Smaller mottes could only support simple towers with room for a few soldiers , whilst larger mottes could be equipped with a much grander keep . Many wooden keeps were designed with a <unk> , a square structure that overhung from the upper floors of the building , enabling better defences and a more sturdy structural design . These wooden keeps could be protected by skins and hides to prevent them being easily set alight during a siege .",
      "Right": "Wooden keeps could be quite extensive in size and , as Robert Higham and Philip Barker have noted , it was possible to build \" ... very tall and massive structures . \" As an example of what these keeps may have comprised , the early 12th-century chronicler Lambert of Ardres described the wooden keep on top of the motte at the castle of Ardres , where the \" ... first storey was on the surface of the ground , where were cellars and granaries , and great boxes , tuns , casks , and other domestic utensils . In the storey above were the dwelling and common living-rooms of the residents in which were the <unk> , the rooms of the bakers and butlers , and the great chamber in which the lord and his wife slept ... In the upper storey of the house were garret rooms ... In this storey also the watchmen and the servants appointed to keep the house took their sleep . \" \n  In the Holy Roman Empire , tall , free-standing wooden towers called Bergfriede were commonly built by the 11th century , either as part of motte-and-bailey designs or , as part of <unk> castles , with characteristic inner and outer courts . Bergfriede , which take their name from the German for a belfry , had similarities to keeps , but are usually distinguished from them on account of Bergfriede having a smaller area or footprint , usually being non-residential and being typically integrated into the outer defences of a castle , rather than being a safe refuge of last resort .",
      "Passage": "One contemporary account of these keeps comes from Jean de Colmieu around 1130 , who described how the nobles of the Calais region would build \" a mound of earth as high as they can and dig a ditch about it as wide and deep as possible . The space on top of the mound is enclosed by a palisade of very strong hewn logs , strengthened at intervals by as many towers as their means can provide . Inside the enclosure is a citadel , or keep , which commands the whole circuit of the defences . The entrance to the fortress is by means of a bridge , which , rising from the outer side of the moat and supported on posts as it ascends , <unk> to the top of the mound . \" At Durham Castle , contemporaries described how the keep arose from the \" tumulus of rising earth \" with a keep reaching \" into thin air , strong within and without \" , a \" stalwart house ... glittering with beauty in every part \" . As well as having defensive value , keeps and mottes sent a powerful political message to the local population ."

It cites some contemporary accounts of how these keeps looked and what they contained, and how they served as both defensive structures and symbols of power. It also mentions a similar type of tower called a Bergfried, which was common in the Holy Roman Empire and had some differences from a keep.",
      "Outcome4": "These keeps were on mounds called mottes, surrounded by a wall and a ditch. A bridge connected the keep to the outer wall. Jean de Colmieu described them as strong and commanding, while Durham Castle was praised for its beauty. Keeps and mottes showed the lord's power to the people.",
      "Outcome5": "Someone wrote about these castles a long time ago. He said that the people who lived in them made a big pile of dirt and dug a deep hole around it. They put wooden walls and towers on top of the dirt pile to keep out enemies. They also built a strong house on the dirt pile, where the boss and his family lived. The only way to get to the house was by walking over a bridge that could be lifted up. Another person wrote about a castle that had a very tall and pretty house on the dirt pile, and everyone could see it from far away. The house had many rooms for different things, like sleeping, eating, or storing food. The people who watched over the castle and the people who worked there also slept in the house, but in smaller rooms. These castles were not just for safety, they also showed everyone how powerful and important the boss was.",

At Durham Castle, another example of this type of castle, we have some contemporary praise for its impressive appearance. The keep was said to rise from the \" tumulus of rising earth \" with such height and strength that it reached \" into thin air , strong within and without \" , forming a \" stalwart house ... glittering with beauty in every part \" . These keeps not only served a military function, but also a symbolic one. They were meant to display the power and authority of their owners over the surrounding lands and people.",

      "Left": "The festival was an important one for the Stones . They had not performed a public concert since their 1967 European Tour , and in 1968 had only performed at the NME Poll Winners Concert and at their television project The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus . In interviews , Mick Jagger stated that he felt the band 's forte was performing live , rather than in the studio , and was keen to return to the stage . Blackhill Enterprises , which had already managed several successful concerts in Hyde Park , including a festival headlined by Blind Faith in June 1969 attended by 150,000 people , were contacted to organise one at the next convenient date after the organiser-compère of that concert , Sam Cutler , had met Jagger in the VIP area at the concert and later at the Royal Albert Hall . When asked why the festival would be free , Jagger noted that they had not made much money from previous concert tours anyway , and that he felt the audience would have a better time if they did not have to pay although he ensured that the cost of the concert would be covered by selling exclusive television rights to Granada Television .",
      "Right": "Mick Taylor , who had by this time obtained a reputation for himself by playing with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers , was invited to work on Let It Bleed . The band enjoyed his contributions and decided to make him an offer to join full-time . After considering this for a few days , he accepted , and his position was officially announced at a press conference in the park 's bandstand on 13 June . The single \" Honky Tonk Women , \" recorded on 1 June with Taylor , was rush-released to tie in with the festival date . The Hyde Park concert would be Taylor 's first gig with the band , and as they had barely had any time to rehearse with him he was understandably nervous , though he later stated that he felt the others , who were far closer to Jones than him , would feel more emotionally drained . Jagger , too , was nervous , unsure whether Jones 's fans would take to Taylor and indeed whether they would boycott the concert ; he did not expect the crowd to match the 150,000 who had come to the Blind Faith gig . In addition , the hot summer had sent the pollen levels soaring and Jagger suffered from hay-fever and laryngitis in the days leading up to the concert .\n Jones died on 3 July , two days before the festival . The Stones were in Olympic Studios when they were told of his death by Ian Stewart , and , although grief-stricken , decided they would go ahead with the gig and dedicate their performance to him . Keith Richards later wrote : \n The all-important thing for us was it was our first appearance for a long time , and with a change of personnel . It was Mick Taylor 's first gig . We were going to do it anyway . Obviously a statement had to be made of one kind or another , so we turned it into a memorial for Brian . We wanted to see him off in grand style . The ups and downs with the guy are one thing , but when his time 's over , release the doves , or in this case the <unk> of white butterflies .\n The band rehearsed at the Beatles ' studio in the basement of 3 Savile Row , and Jagger and Richards came up with a 14-song set ; the Hyde Park concert would be the first time many of the songs had been played before a public audience .",
      "Passage": "However , the gradual estrangement of Brian Jones and his decreasing musical contributions – he had only appeared on two tracks on the then in-progress Let It Bleed — made a return to touring problematic .

By June 1969 , matters had finally come to a head and it was decided that Jones should be replaced for the gig ."

      "Outcome1": "However , the festival also marked a turning point for the Stones , as they had to deal with the departure of Brian Jones and his replacement by Mick Taylor . Jones had been increasingly marginalised in the band 's musical direction and had only played on two tracks on the upcoming album Let It Bleed . His erratic behaviour and substance abuse made him unreliable and difficult to work with . The band finally decided to fire him in June 1969 , after consulting with their manager Allen Klein . Mick Taylor , a young and talented guitarist who had impressed them with his work with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers , was invited to join the band and record some tracks for Let It Bleed . He accepted the offer and was officially introduced as the new member at a press conference in Hyde Park on 13 June . The band hoped that he would bring a fresh energy and sound to their live performances , which they had not done since their 1967 European Tour . The new single \" Honky Tonk Women , \" featuring Taylor 's guitar work , was released to coincide with the festival date . The Hyde Park concert would be Taylor 's debut gig with the Stones , but he was not the only one feeling nervous . Jagger later recalled : \n I was very apprehensive about playing in front of such a big crowd ... I did n't know how they would react to Mick Taylor or whether they 'd miss Brian or even resent us for kicking him out .\n Sam Cutler , who had organised the festival and acted as its compère , also sensed some tension among the band members : \n They were all very edgy ... They had n't played live for so long and they were breaking in a new guitarist ... And of course there was this huge shadow of Brian hanging over them .\n John Mayall , who had mentored Taylor and encouraged him to join the Stones , was proud of his former protégé but also worried about how he would cope with the pressure : \n He was such a brilliant player ... But he was also very shy and modest ... I wondered how he would fit in with their personalities and lifestyle .\n The audience , however, seemed to be mostly supportive and curious about the new line-up . Some of them had brought banners and posters expressing their love for Jones or welcoming Taylor . Others were just eager to hear some new songs from their favourite band . As one fan put it : \n We did n't care who was playing guitar ... We just wanted to see the Stones rock Hyde Park .",
      "Outcome2": "However , the band faced a problem with Brian Jones 's growing alienation and his diminishing musical contributions – he had only played on two tracks on the then in-progress Let It Bleed. They wanted to resume touring , but they could not rely on Jones . They had scrapped The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus after The Who had outshone them . By June 1969 , they had reached a breaking point and decided to replace Jones for the gig .",

By June 1969 , matters had finally come to a head and it was decided that Jones should be replaced for the gig .",
      "Outcome4": "But Jones had grown distant and less involved musically – he only played on two songs for the upcoming Let It Bleed. This made touring difficult. They had scrapped The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus after losing to The Who. In June 1969, they agreed to replace Jones for the gig.",
      "Outcome5": "But Brian Jones was not happy in the band and he did not play much music with them anymore. They wanted someone else to play with them instead. They found a new friend named Mick Taylor who was very good at playing guitar. They asked him to join their band and he said yes. They were going to play a big show in the park for many people to see. It would be the first time that Mick Taylor played with them, so they were all excited and nervous. But then something very sad happened. Brian Jones died just before the show. The band was very sad and they decided to say goodbye to him at the show. They also wanted to make the show very special for him and for Mick Taylor.",
      "Outcome6": "However , the situation with Brian Jones was a major obstacle for the band 's return to live performance . Jones had become increasingly alienated from the rest of the Stones and his musical contributions had dwindled to a minimum – he had only played on two tracks on the album Let It Bleed , which was still in progress at the time . The band felt that they could not rely on him for a concert and that they needed a replacement . They had also been disappointed by their own performance at The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus , where they felt they had been overshadowed by The Who . In June 1969 , they made the decision to part ways with Jones and look for a new guitarist . They found one in Mick Taylor , who had impressed them with his work with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers . They invited him to join them in the studio for Let It Bleed and liked his style and input so much that they offered him a full-time position in the band . Taylor accepted after some hesitation , and his official announcement as a new member of the Rolling Stones was made at a press conference in Hyde Park on 13 June . The band also rushed to release their new single \" Honky Tonk Women , \" which featured Taylor 's guitar playing , to coincide with the festival date . The Hyde Park concert would be Taylor 's debut with the band , and he was understandably nervous about it , as he had hardly any time to rehearse with them . He later said that he felt more sorry for the others , who had shared a long history with Jones and would be more affected by his absence . Jagger was also anxious about how the fans would react to Taylor and whether they would miss Jones too much to enjoy the show ; he did not think that they would attract as many people as Blind Faith had done a month earlier . To make matters worse , Jagger suffered from hay-fever and laryngitis in the days before the concert due to the hot summer weather and high pollen levels .",

She had 49 girls in her school and they learned many things from five teachers. Miss Hewett was the boss of the school for a long time, until she got old and retired. Then the school moved to another building that had a special place where they could act out stories. But later, they had to leave that building for a while because they wanted to make it better and nicer. So they went to another place for four seasons and then came back to their new and old building.",

It first occupied a building in West Avenue Road and then relocated to Church Hill House, where a church now stands. At that time, the school also accepted boys up to the age of 13 years. It was in September 1913 that the school settled in its current building, which was later enhanced by the addition of the Greek Theatre in the 1920s. However, in July 2008, the school underwent a major transformation as it moved off site for four terms to allow for a comprehensive building and refurbishment programme that created a unique blend of traditional and modern facilities that we enjoy today.",

There he discovers that Nahum is keeping a space rock in his basement and using it to grow giant vegetation and mutated animals .

He is persuaded by Charlie Davidson ( Steve Carlisle ) , a greedy realtor who wants to sell the land to the Tennessee Valley Authority ( TVA ) for a reservoir project , not to report his findings to anyone . However , as the meteorite dissolves , it releases a mysterious colour that infects the soil and water of the farm . Soon , the crops grow abnormally large but are rotten and tasteless inside . The animals and people on the farm also start to show signs of mutation and madness . Nathan and his son Cyrus ( Malcolm <unk> ) become more violent and paranoid , while his wife and daughter succumb to horrible deformities . Only Zack ( Wil Wheaton ) and Alice ( Amy Wheaton ) , Nathan's children from a previous marriage , remain sane and try to escape from their nightmarish situation .

Group manipulation commands are carried in MIH_Net_Group_Manipulate request or indication messages, which can be either unicast or multicast, or in MIH_MN_Group_Manipulate response messages, which are always unicast. These messages are digitally signed by the MIHF that originates them, to ensure their authenticity and integrity.

One of the main criticisms of tourism is that it often leads to the construction of more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may encroach on natural habitats and biodiversity. For example, in Bali, Indonesia, many forests and rice fields have been cleared to make way for hotels, golf courses and shopping malls. Tourism also generates more pollution and waste, such as increased emission of greenhouse gases from air travel, littering and vandalism at scenic spots, and excessive consumption of water, power and other resources in accommodation sectors. These factors suggest that tourism exerts a heavy burden on ecosystem and local resources, and it should be discouraged.",
      "Outcome2": "It is true that tourism can pose a threat to the natural environment. To cater for the demands of tourists, local authorities may construct more buildings and facilities near tourist sites, which could lead to the loss of natural habitats. Tourism also generates more pollution and waste, such as increasing emission of greenhouse gases, discarded rubbish and excessive consumption of water, electricity and other forms of energy in lavish hotels. Based on these reasons, it seems that tourism exerts great strain on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be promoted.",
      "Outcome3": "Is tourism really a threat to the natural environment? Some people may think so, considering the negative effects of tourism development on wildlife and ecosystems. They may point out that tourism leads to more construction, pollution and waste, which can harm the environment in various ways. For example, building more hotels and resorts can destroy natural habitats, while increasing greenhouse gas emissions and water consumption. According to this perspective, tourism is an unsustainable activity that should be discouraged.",

    "Context": {
      "Left": "This bill is substantially similar to a bill introduced in the previous Parliament. This Digest deals with any comments on the new provisions.\n The Committee dealt with this bill in Alert Digest No. The Minister responded to the Committee's comments in a letter dated on 28 January 2011. A copy of the letter is attached to this report.\n This bill inserts a new Part VIA, into the Defence Act 1903 and makes associated amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979.\n The bill will enhance the security of Defence bases, facilities, assets, and personnel within Australia in response to the changing nature of security threats. These amendments include:\n- clarifying that appropriately authorised members of the Defence Force may use reasonable and necessary force, including lethal force, to prevent the death of, or serious injury to a person in connection with an attack on Defence premises;\n- establishing a statutory regime of search and seizure powers that will operate at Defence premises to reduce the risk of dangerous items entering Defence facilities, or material and classified information being unlawfully removed;\n- updating and relocating the trespass offence and related arrest power in section 82 of the Act;\n- supporting the enforcement of the trespass offence by authorising Defence to use overt optical surveillance devices to monitor the security of Defence premises and to disclose the information captured by these devices to law enforcement agencies and Commonwealth, State and Territory public prosecution authorities; and\n- clarifying that this Part does not limit the exercise of powers of a defence security official, a member of the Defence Force or any other person, under this Act or any other law.\n Undue trespass on personal rights and liberties\nPart IVA\nItem 1 of Schedule 1 introduces new Part IVA, relating to the security of defence premises, into the Defence Act 1903. Among other things, this new Part introduces a number of powers allowing for the consensual and non-consensual collection of information (such as identification information and whether or not a person has authority to enter defence premises) and searches (of persons and vehicles) at defence access control points or on defence premises.\n The new Part IVA also provides for the seizure of things on defence premises or found as a result of a search if it is reasonably believed that the item constitutes a threat to the safety of persons on the premises or relates to a criminal offence that has or may be committed on the premises.",
      "Right": "In the Committee's view the general question of whether an appropriate balance has been struck in these provisions between (1) personal rights and liberties and (2) interests in maintaining the security of Defence bases and responding to security threats is a question which may appropriately be left to the consideration of the Senate as a whole.\n However, the Committee has a number of particular concerns about the detail of the bill. Given the seriousness of many of the amendments, including authorising non-consensual searches and the use of lethal force in particular circumstances, the Committee seeks the Minister's advice as to whether defence premises (as defined in clause 71A) includes land which may have a defence purpose, but which is also being used for another purpose (such as an immigration facility) and generally whether it is appropriate for the amendments to apply to all defence premises.\n The Committee also seeks the Minister's advice as to whether consideration has been given to adequately warning persons entering defence premises that they may be subject to non-consensual searches if they enter the premises. Such a warning may offer a practical protection to personal rights without undermining the purposes sought to be achieved by the amendments.\n Further, although clause 72J states that the powers given to restrain and detain under the amendments can only be exercised for the purpose of placing a person as soon as possible into the custody of the police or a protective service officer, the Committee is concerned that the bill does not deal with the adequacy of the training of defence security officials to ensure these 'police powers' are exercised safely and appropriately. The Committee therefore also seeks the Minister's advice about the adequacy of training and whether appropriate parameters for training requirements can be included in the bill.\n Pending the Minister's advice, the Committee draws Senators' attention to the provisions, as they may be considered to trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, in breach of principle 1(a)(i) of the Committee's terms of reference.\n Issue: Whether the definition of defence premises includes land which may have a Defence purpose, but which is also being used for another purpose (such as an immigration facility) and generally whether it is appropriate for the amendments to apply to all defence premises.\n Land or buildings that may have a Defence purpose, but which are not currently used by the Defence Force or the Department of Defence do not meet the definition of defence premises included in the Bill.",
      "Passage": "Clearly, these powers are coercive and have the potential to trespass on personal liberty and property rights. However, Division 6 of the new Part IVA specifies limitations and safeguards on the exercise of the powers conferred. In particular, it is noted that the powers to restrain and detain persons are only conferred for the purpose of placing the person into the custody of a civil police officer, including a protective service officer of the AFP at the earliest practicable time (section 72J)."

      "Outcome2": "These powers are intrusive and may infringe on personal liberty and property rights. Therefore, Division 6 of the new Part IVA sets out some restrictions and protections for the use of these powers.

      "Outcome5": "Some people who work for the Defence Force have special jobs to keep their places safe from bad people. These people can ask other people who come to their places for their names and what they are doing there. They can also look inside their bags or cars to see if they have anything dangerous or wrong. If they find something bad, they can take it away and call the police. They can also stop someone from leaving until the police come, but only if they really need to. Sometimes, they might have to use force or even guns to protect themselves or others from being hurt by bad people.",

Then, they can focus on the things that will help them reach their dreams.",
      "Outcome6": "Another important reason why people attend university is to prepare for their future career.

Disagreement on fair price of milk with small group of local producers goes to review board. Transactions themselves took place solely within Que though.\n Analysis: Rejection of purely geo test (if something takes place WITHIN the prov = INTRAprov), for a test about AIM of legislation: it will be intra prov if it is aimed or directed at trade within the province, and not at interprov trade (can have incidental effects).\n Decision: leg is not aimed at interprov and impact is incidental (not the P&S of the legislation).

The worry is that leg like MB's (here) or like Que did in Carnation the spill-over impacts are on others who can't vote in that province (raising costs), thus the courts should protect the interests from outside. General philosophy: judicial restraint, except when leg designed clearly to protect provinces own interest, then careful scrutiny.\n Agricultural Products Marketing Act Reference: Court deciding NOT to interfere with prov/fed cooperative scheme that was carefully drafted\nF: feds & prov agreed wrt many agri prods (incl eggs) that Canada should be divided into various regional components and each prov given a production quota (on how much they can make). Feds put quotas on the individual producers + global and, prov puts quotas on ALL OF THOSE SAME individual producers, on grounds of being in the prov. Challenge: prov individual quotas -> you're regulating some products that might be interprov/international.\n Reasons: judges have been telling govts to cooperate and sort out federalism issues together. If they were working on it for 40 years, judges deferential here to the scheme (won't say it's unconst).\n CH 10 - Natural Resources\n92A and others -> ownership of natural resources specifically granted (with exceptions) to prov.\n Context: Canada producing a lot of own oil (Alta + Sask) during dramatic increase.\n Canadian Industrial Gas and Oil Ltd. V Saskatchewan: Weakening prov powers, ended up affecting/being aimed at internat/interprov trade\nF: oil CO is arguing against const of kicker prov above, and is tantamount to prov trying regulate interprov and interprovtrade + indirect taxation (can only do direct).

Que had cheaper and better chickens than Ont, and Ont had better eggs. Both provinces wanted to access each other's market, but also protect their own producers. They enacted marketing schemes that were subtly protectionist, making it hard for MB to enter either market. MB was good at producing both eggs and chickens, and wanted to sell them across Canada. Since MB could not challenge the constitutionality of Que and Ont's schemes directly, it decided to enact a similar scheme for eggs as Que did, and then refer its own law to the court.

      "Outcome4": "After a complaint that Gaylord Opryland blocked personal hotspot devices in its convention space, the Bureau investigated Marriott's compliance with Section 333 of the Act and reached the attached Consent Decree. Under the Consent Decree, Marriott must pay a $600,000 civil penalty, implement a compliance plan, and report any Wi-Fi monitoring system usage at its U.S. properties.",
      "Outcome5": "Someone told us that a big hotel called Gaylord Opryland did something bad. They stopped people from using their own Wi-Fi devices that they brought with them. We wanted to find out if this was true and if the hotel broke any rules. We talked to the hotel and they agreed to do some things to make up for what they did. They will pay a lot of money, they will follow a plan to be good, and they will tell us what they are doing with their Wi-Fi systems.",
      "Outcome6": "After receiving a complaint in March 2013 from a person who had attended an event at the Gaylord Opryland, the Bureau initiated an investigation to determine whether Marriott had violated Section 333 of the Act by interfering with consumers' ability to create their own Wi-Fi networks using personal hotspot devices. The investigation revealed that Marriott had deployed a Wi-Fi monitoring system at the Gaylord Opryland that contained features that could be used to prevent or disrupt the operation of such devices. The Bureau and Marriott have reached a settlement to resolve the investigation, which is embodied in the attached Consent Decree. Under the terms of the Consent Decree, Marriott agrees to, among other things, (i) pay a civil penalty of $600,000 to the United States Treasury, (ii) develop and implement a compliance plan that ensures that it does not use any Wi-Fi blocking technology or practices at any U.S. property that it manages or owns, and (iii) submit periodic reports to the Bureau that demonstrate its compliance with the Consent Decree and disclose any use of Wi-Fi monitoring systems that have containment capabilities.",

      "Outcome5": "Imagine you work for a company that makes things for teachers, like books or pencils. You want to sell more of your things to the teachers, but there are many other companies that make similar things. How can you make the teachers choose your things over the others?\n One way is to help the teachers learn new skills and be happier in their lives. Teachers need to learn new skills to do their jobs well, and they also need to take care of themselves and their families. Sometimes they have problems or worries that make them feel bad or stressed. If you can help them with these things, they will like you more and trust you more.\n That's what TeacherCoach does. TeacherCoach is a special website that has many videos and games that teach teachers new skills and help them with their problems or worries. Teachers can watch these videos and play these games for free on their computers or phones. They can also talk to other teachers or experts who can help them with their questions or challenges.\n But TeacherCoach needs money to keep making these videos and games, so they ask companies like yours to help them. You can give some money to TeacherCoach, and in return, TeacherCoach will let you put your name and picture on some of the videos and games that you helped pay for. This way, when teachers watch those videos or play those games, they will see your name and picture, and they will know that you helped them learn new skills and be happier. They will also see a button that takes them to your website, where they can see more of your things and buy them if they want.\n This is good for everyone: TeacherCoach gets money to keep helping teachers, you get more attention from teachers who might buy your things, and the teachers get free videos and games that help them with their work and life.",

      "Left": "Most people avoid thinking if they can , some of us are addicted to thinking , but von Neumann actually enjoyed thinking , maybe even to the exclusion of everything else . \" \n  Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim described von Neumann as the \" fastest mind I ever met \" , and Jacob Bronowski wrote \" He was the cleverest man I ever knew , without exception . He was a genius . \" George Pólya , whose lectures at ETH Zürich von Neumann attended as a student , said \" Johnny was the only student I was ever afraid of . If in the course of a lecture I stated an unsolved problem , the chances were he 'd come to me at the end of the lecture with the complete solution scribbled on a slip of paper . \" Halmos recounts a story told by Nicholas Metropolis , concerning the speed of von Neumann 's calculations , when somebody asked von Neumann to solve the famous fly puzzle : \n Two bicyclists start twenty miles apart and head toward each other , each going at a steady rate of 10 mph . At the same time a fly that travels at a steady 15 mph starts from the front wheel of the southbound bicycle and flies to the front wheel of the northbound one , then turns around and flies to the front wheel of the southbound one again , and continues in this manner till he is crushed between the two front wheels . Question : what total distance did the fly cover ? The slow way to find the answer is to calculate what distance the fly covers on the first , northbound , leg of the trip , then on the second , southbound , leg , then on the third , etc . , etc . , and , finally , to sum the infinite series so obtained . The quick way is to observe that the bicycles meet exactly one hour after their start , so that the fly had just an hour for his travels ; the answer must therefore be 15 miles . When the question was put to von Neumann , he solved it in an instant , and thereby disappointed the questioner : \" Oh , you must have heard the trick before ! \" \" What trick ? \" asked von Neumann , \" All I did was sum the geometric series . \" \n  Eugene Wigner told a similar story , only with a swallow instead of a fly , and says it was Max Born who posed the question to von Neumann in the 1920s .",
      "Right": "Ulam noted that von Neumann 's way of thinking might not be visual , but more of an aural one .\n \" I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann 's does not indicate a species superior to that of man \" , said Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe of Cornell University . \" It seems fair to say that if the influence of a scientist is interpreted broadly enough to include impact on fields beyond science proper , then John von Neumann was probably the most influential mathematician who ever lived , \" wrote Miklós <unk> in \" Selected Letters . \" James <unk> wrote : \" he is regarded as one of the giants of modern mathematics \" . The mathematician Jean Dieudonné said that von Neumann \" may have been the last representative of a once-flourishing and numerous group , the great mathematicians who were equally at home in pure and applied mathematics and who throughout their careers maintained a steady production in both directions \" , while Peter Lax described him as possessing the \" most scintillating intellect of this century \" .",
      "Passage": "Herman Goldstine wrote : \n One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall . As far as I could tell , von Neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim ; moreover , he could do it years later without hesitation . He could also translate it at no diminution in speed from its original language into English . On one occasion I tested his ability by asking him to tell me how A Tale of Two Cities started . Whereupon , without any pause , he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes ."

He could do this even after many years . He could also say it in a different language if he wanted to . Once I asked him to tell me the beginning of a story called A Tale of Two Cities . He started to say the words right away and did not stop for a long time until I told him to .",
      "Outcome6": "One of the most impressive aspects of von Neumann's mind was his prodigious memory . He had the ability to recall anything he had ever read , word for word , and to recite it in any language he knew . He could effortlessly switch from one language to another , without any loss of speed or accuracy . Herman Goldstine , who worked with von Neumann at the Institute for Advanced Study , gave an example of this remarkable feat . He asked von Neumann to tell him how the novel A Tale of Two Cities began . Without any hesitation , von Neumann started to quote the first chapter verbatim , and continued for several minutes until Goldstine stopped him . He did not miss a single word or punctuation mark , and his intonation was perfect .",

However, this view ignores the fact that many low-income families cannot afford to send their children to private schools, and that they rely on public schools to provide them with a decent education. By paying taxes for public education, rich parents are not only fulfilling their civic duty, but also supporting the development of human capital and social mobility in society.

In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country.",
      "Right": "To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.",
      "Passage": "In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of \"no\", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams."

They may think that failure is the end of their journey, rather than a learning opportunity. But this attitude can limit their potential and prevent them from having diverse experiences. For example, Walt Disney, who created a legacy in animation, faced many rejections and hardships in his career. Some of his stories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were rejected by publishers. He was even fired by an editor who said he lacked imagination. But he did not let these failures stop him from pursuing his vision. He took risks and experimented with new ideas and techniques.",
      "Outcome2": "Indeed, taking risks and failing is a common fear among many people. According to a survey by Chapman University, 35.7% of Americans reported being afraid or very afraid of failing. However, failure can also be a valuable lesson and a motivation to keep trying. As Walt Disney, the renowned animator and entrepreneur, once said: \"All the adversity I've had in my life, all my troubles and obstacles, have strengthened me... You may not realize it when it happens, but a kick in the teeth may be the best thing in the world for you.\" Disney faced many rejections and setbacks in his career, such as losing the rights to his first successful character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, having some of his stories like Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs rejected by distributors, and being fired by an editor who claimed he lacked imagination. Despite all these challenges, he never gave up on his dreams and became one of the most influential figures in entertainment history.",
      "Outcome3": "However, taking risks and pursuing new opportunities can also be daunting for many people. They might fear failure and disappointment along the way. For example, Walt Disney, whose career is widely admired, had to overcome many hardships. He faced rejection and criticism for some of his stories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs. He was even fired by an editor who claimed that he had no imagination. Despite all these challenges, he never stopped chasing his dreams.",
      "Outcome4": "However, many people fear risks and failure. Frustration may arise, but giving up on dreams is not an option. For example, Walt Disney, a famous careerist, faced many rejections. Some editors dismissed his stories like Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs. One even fired him for lacking imagination. Despite all this, he never stopped chasing his dreams.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people are scared to try new things and make mistakes. They think they will be sad if they don't do well. But it is very important to keep trying and not give up on what you want. For example, there was a man who liked to draw funny animals and tell stories about them. But many people did not like his drawings or stories. They said no to him and told him he had no good ideas. He was very sad, but he did not stop drawing and telling stories. He worked hard and believed in himself.",
      "Outcome6": "However, not everyone is willing to take risks and face the possibility of failure. Many people prefer to stay in their comfort zone and avoid challenging themselves. They may fear rejection, criticism, or disappointment. But this attitude can limit their growth and potential. A good example of someone who overcame these fears and achieved great success is Walt Disney, the famous animator and entrepreneur. He faced many hardships and setbacks in his career, such as losing the rights to his first cartoon character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and having some of his stories rejected by distributors, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs. He even got fired by a newspaper editor who said he lacked imagination and creativity. But he did not let these failures stop him from pursuing his dreams. He kept working hard, innovating, and creating new characters and stories that enchanted millions of people around the world.",

According to a survey by Pew Research Center, 83% of social media users say that these platforms help them feel closer to friends and family who live far away, and 67% say they help them share important events in their lives. Furthermore, social networks can also facilitate cross-cultural communication and understanding by exposing us to different perspectives and experiences around the world. Therefore, I believe that social networks are not destroying relationships, but rather enhancing them in various ways.",
      "Outcome4": "Technology is rapidly improving our world with its convenience and innovation. Smart phones, for example, can help people navigate in remote areas and stay connected with their loved ones through social networks. Contrary to some critics, I believe that social networks can enhance rather than harm our relationships and friendships.",
      "Outcome5": "There are many things in the world that can help us do things more easily and faster. One of these things is a small device that we can carry with us everywhere. It is called a smart phone. It can do many amazing things, like showing us the way if we get lost in a big place, or letting us talk to our friends and family who live far away from us. We can see their faces and hear their voices on the screen, even if they are in another country. Some people may think that this makes us less friendly, because we don't talk to them in person. But I think it makes us more friendly, because we can always stay connected and share our feelings and stories.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main reasons why I believe we live in a better world than the past is the rapid and remarkable development of technology, which has transformed various aspects of our lives and made them more convenient and comfortable. A salient example that illustrates this point is the invention of smart phones, which are not only devices for communication, but also multifunctional tools that can help us in different situations. For instance, the powerful navigation system installed on the phones has been a lifesaver for many people who got lost or stranded in remote areas like forests or deserts, by providing them with accurate directions and emergency contacts. Furthermore, some people may argue that social networks have a negative impact on our relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication and creating a sense of isolation. However, I think that social networks such as Facebook have a positive role in strengthening the bonds between friends and family members who are separated by distance or circumstances, by enabling them to stay in touch, share their news and feelings, and support each other, which was very difficult or impossible to do less than 20 years ago.",

Competence in reading is the key to independent learning and therefore the teaching of reading is given a high priority by all staff. Success in reading has a direct effect on progress in all areas of the curriculum and is crucial in developing children's self-esteem, confidence and motivation. Through reading many doors and avenues are opened up for further learning. '",
      "Right": "To develop a love of books and reading in every child\nTo develop reading strategies and skills: fluency, accuracy, understanding and response to different texts\nTo create a strong, embedded reading culture through a rich language environment within classrooms and the wider school environment\nTo deliver a structured and consistent whole school approach to reading\nTo recognise the value of parents/carers as essential components in supporting and developing children's reading skills and love of reading\nTo rigorously monitor and assess children's progress in reading and identify those who require extra support and intervene at an early stage '\nThere is a whole school approach to the teaching of reading. A wide range of reading strategies will be taught throughout all classes to meet the learning needs of our children and that reflect the requirements of the National Curriculum and EYFS Development Matters programme. '\n Guided Reading sessions are timetabled in every year group and take place at least twice per week. The class is divided into groups of children of similar reading ability. The text should be carefully selected at instructional level for the group, whilst providing an element of challenge. Plans for each session should reflect a specific teaching focus appropriate to the group. '\n In EYFS and Year One where children are still accessing phonics, guided reading sessions may take place within the phonics session. '\n Individual Reading In Reception, Key Stage 1 and, where appropriate in Key Stage 2, children will be given a reading book at the appropriate book band to take home, together with a Reading Record Book. Children in Reception and Key Stage 1 will read to a teacher or Teaching Assistant at least once a week. '\n Accelerated Reading As children become secure at applying phonics (on average at the end of year one/start of year two) and become confident readers, they will be introduced to the Accelerated Reader program. Once an Accelerated Reader, children will have the opportunity to select their own reading book from the appropriate level and log into their account to take a short comprehension quiz upon completion of a book. Children quiz on their individual reading book and where available their Guided Reading and Library book also. At key stage 2 children have an allocated afternoon session, where they go to the library, read their book and quiz on the book. This is over seen by the Library Manager. The children are also able to read, quiz and change\ntheir books at dinner time- again supervised by the Library Manager and also the Headteacher.",

In the absence of evidence indicating the source of any water in the fuel , the Inquiry dismissed the submission that water was responsible for the accident . The Inquiry did not determine the cause of the accident but it made recommendations to enhance the safety of aircraft operations .",

When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines . After a preliminary investigation , Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine , and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion .

The engine problems seemed to vary in severity as the flight continued, as witnesses reported hearing different engine noises at different times. Sometimes, they heard normal engine sounds, sometimes they heard silence, and sometimes they heard a very loud and high-pitched screeching sound. The investigators who examined the wreckage later found that two of the engines had a significant amount of corrosion product in their fuel systems.

Cartoon Network , Suncoast , and Diamond Distributors signed on as promotional partners . Though based on Weekly Shōnen Jump , Viz noted that it would not be a \" word for word \" copy . Rather , Viz would select series for its magazine that it felt were the most appropriate for its American readers . Viz 's version was also set to be monthly , rather than having weekly , to better fit the American comic distribution system .\n We will be selecting the material most appropriate for the American market . Bear in mind that Shonen Jump has been running since 1968 in Japan . At 500 pages a week , that gives us 884,000 pages of material to draw from ! ... Our lead titles are Dragon Ball Z and Yu-Gi-Oh , selected for their already-existing popularity in the US . The remainder of the titles will be a combination of those on the verge of breaking out in this country , and those we feel will especially appeal to the target demographic .\n Jason Thompson , one of Viz 's manga editors for series including Dragon Ball was selected as the magazine 's first editor-in-chief . Initially , Viz hoped to have the magazine targeted to all age groups , however to allow for greater freedom on content , the decision was made to mark the magazine as being for readers 13 years of age and older . However , with greater attention being focused on manga as it became available in mainstream outlets , some titles were edited for content . Thompson noted that it was a challenge working with some of the artists whose works would appear in the first issue , who worried about excessive alterations .",
      "Right": "Unlike with most magazine launches , Viz decided to allow retailers to return the first two issues . This gave retailers a chance to see how well the magazine would sell in markets where manga anthologies were an unknown . Retailers were also given a quantity of free samples , distributed 100,000 free samples at Comic Con , and another 100,000 were made available to its partner Suncoast . Cartoon Network began providing sample chapters and streaming video content to its Adult Swim website , along with prominent links to Shonen Jump 's official site .\n The first issue was released November 26 , 2002 , with a January 2003 cover date . It premiered with five series : Dragon Ball Z , Sand Land , Yu-Gi-Oh ! , <unk> Hakusho , and One Piece . With the launch of the magazine considered successful , Thompson was offered an opportunity to intern in Japan with Shueisha 's editors , but declined , due to a lack of interest in the management aspects of the business and a desire to work on his own projects . After six issues had been released , Thompson desired to work on authoring and illustrating his own comic The Stiff . Reflecting back later , he states in an interview with The Comics Journal that \" I basically told Viz that I wanted to work part time or I 'd quit . It probably wasn 't a really nice thing to do . \" He eventually stepped down as editor-in-chief , being replaced by his former boss Yumi Hoashi .\n In February 2005 , Viz announced the creation of Shojo Beat , a sister publication of Shonen Jump geared towards female readers . The first issue was released in June 2005 with a July 2005 date cover ; it ran for 47 issues until it was discontinued with the release of the July 2009 issue . In 2006 , Marc Weidenbaum was named as the Editor-in-Chief for both magazines . Weidenbaum remained the magazine 's editor until February 13 , 2009 , when Viz announced that he had left the company ; the magazine 's new editor-in-chief has not been named .\n As of the June 2011 issue , only 10 issues were published in a year . The magazine is printed at <unk> Printing <unk> Graphics in Owen Sound , Ontario , Canada .",
      "Passage": "With manga anthologies having met with little success in North America , Viz desired Shonen Jump to have a circulation of 1 million within its first three years . To aid in this goal , Viz launched the magazine with a multimillion-dollar advertising budget , they advertised and distributed the title through mass market outlets rather than just pop culture stores , ensuring the magazine included series already popular with the North American audience due to their airing on Cartoon Network . To help fund the lengthy , expensive marketing campaign developed around Shonen Jump , Shueisha purchased an equity interest in Viz in August 2002 ."

Shueisha also bought an equity interest in Viz in August 2002 to support the marketing campaign .",
      "Outcome2": "Shonen Jump was a big project for Viz, and they wanted it to be popular in North America. They had a lot of money to spend on advertising, and they chose stories that people already knew from TV. They also worked with Shueisha, the company that made the original magazine in Japan. Shueisha helped them by buying part of Viz in 2002.",
      "Outcome3": "Building on the success of Weekly Shōnen Jump in Japan, Viz aimed to replicate it in North America with Shonen Jump. However, they faced some challenges and risks in launching a manga anthology in a market where they were not very popular. To overcome these obstacles, Viz adopted several strategies to promote and distribute the magazine. They also partnered with Shueisha, the original publisher of Weekly Shōnen Jump, who invested in Viz to support their ambitious goal of reaching 1 million circulation within three years.",
      "Outcome4": "Shonen Jump's launch in North America was a risky but ambitious project for Viz, who aimed to reach 1 million circulation in three years. They invested heavily in advertising and distribution, and partnered with Shueisha, Cartoon Network, Suncoast, and Diamond Distributors. They also chose series that were already popular or had potential appeal to American readers.",

They wanted many kids to read it, so they worked with other companies to tell people about it. They also picked stories that kids already liked or would like. One company from Japan helped Viz with money and stories. They had a lot of stories to choose from.",
      "Outcome6": "Launching a manga anthology in North America was a risky venture, as previous attempts had failed to attract a large audience. Viz set an ambitious goal of reaching 1 million subscribers within three years of Shonen Jump's debut. To achieve this, Viz invested heavily in advertising and marketing the magazine, and partnered with companies like Cartoon Network, Suncoast, and Diamond Distributors to promote and distribute it. Viz also made sure to include series that were already familiar and popular with American fans, such as Dragon Ball Z and Yu-Gi-Oh!, which had anime adaptations airing on TV. In addition, Viz selected series that they thought would appeal to the target demographic of young male readers, such as One Piece and <unk> Hakusho. Viz also wanted to make the magazine accessible to mass market retailers, so they decided to publish it monthly instead of weekly, as the original Weekly Shōnen Jump was in Japan. Furthermore, Viz allowed retailers to return unsold copies of the first two issues, which reduced the risk of stocking the magazine. To further boost Shonen Jump's visibility and popularity, Viz distributed free samples of the magazine at various events and venues, such as Comic Con and Suncoast stores. They also collaborated with Cartoon Network's website Adult Swim to provide online previews and videos of the manga series featured in the magazine. Shueisha, the Japanese publisher of Weekly Shōnen Jump, supported Viz's efforts by acquiring a stake in the company in August 2002.",

Sometimes when enemies are defeated , they drop items ; the player can carry items with them , which are grouped into stacks , each taking up one slot in the inventory .\n During battles , a weapon limit gauge is shown , filling up over time ; by waiting to attack until the gauge is filled up , the player can use a more powerful attack specific to the currently equipped weapon . The gauge resets to zero whenever the player attacks or gets hit by an attack . The player is able to use various different types of weapons , such as swords , axes and flails , each having a different attack pattern : sword attacks , for example , are mid-ranged swings and stabs , while flail attacks are long-ranged and reach out in a straight line from the hero . Most weapons can also be used to affect the environment : the player can cut down trees with axes , for instance . There are also variants of each weapon type with bonus strengths , such as flame variations , which are effective against ice monsters .

The weapon limit gauge is a unique feature of the game that affects the power of the hero 's attacks ; it fills up gradually and allows the hero to unleash a special attack when full . The hero can also switch between different weapons with varying attack patterns and environmental effects . For example, swords are good for close-range combat and stabbing enemies , while flails can reach faraway enemies and pull switches . Some weapons also have elemental properties that make them more effective against certain enemies .

      "Left": "First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.",
      "Right": "Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people.",
      "Passage": "In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field."

      "Outcome1": "Furthermore, students have different needs and preferences depending on their major. The university should prioritize the equipment that is essential for physical education students, who rely on physical activities for their learning and career development. On the other hand, for students who study engineering or medicine, it would be more beneficial to invest in their laboratories, where they can use advanced technology to enhance their skills and knowledge. According to a survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, engineering and health sciences majors are among the most in-demand fields in the job market, which means that they need more resources and support from the university to prepare them for their future careers.",
      "Outcome2": "However, not all students have the same needs or preferences when it comes to physical activities. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students, because their major is completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student, I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really makes the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe discover new things in their field.",
      "Outcome3": "Another point is that students have different needs depending on their majors. The university should prioritize the equipment that is essential for physical education students, who rely on physical activities for their studies and careers. On the other hand, for students who major in engineering or medicine, it would be more beneficial to invest in their laboratories, where they can use advanced technology to learn and discover new things in their fields.",
      "Outcome4": "Moreover, the university should cater to the needs of different majors. Physical education students need the best equipment for their training and learning. However, other students may benefit more from investing in their laboratories and classrooms. For example, engineers and doctors would be more motivated to learn with advanced technology and facilities.",
      "Outcome5": "Some students study how to move their bodies well, like running or jumping. They need good things to help them learn, like balls or ropes. The school should give them these things because they are important for their study. But other students study different things, like how to make machines or how to cure sick people. They also need good things to help them learn, like tools or books. The school should not give the first group of students more things than the second group of students, because that is not fair. Both groups of students should have what they need to learn well.",
      "Outcome6": "Moreover, students have different preferences and needs depending on their major. The university should prioritize the equipment that is essential for the physical education students, who are constantly engaged in physical activities as part of their curriculum. On the other hand, for students who are studying engineering or medicine, it would not be fair to allocate more funds to gyms than to their laboratories, where they can use cutting-edge technology to learn and discover new things in their field.",

Type A school buses can be split into two sub-groups; Type A-1, having a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) of 10,000 pounds or less, and Type A-2, having a GVWR of 10,000 pounds or more.\n Type B - Chassis type is \"Conventional\"\nThe Type B school bus is a bus body constructed and installed upon a front-section vehicle chassis, or stripped chassis, with a GVWR of more than 10,000 pounds; these are much smaller than a standard conventional school bus and designed to carry 10 to 27 students. Part of the engine is beneath and/or behind the windshield and beside the driver's seat, the entrance door is then placed behind the front wheels. While usage of this type is rarer today it still meets all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and is designed for specific school district needs.",
      "Right": "Type D - Chassis type is \"Transit-style\"\nThe Type D, or \"transit-style\" school bus, is a body installed upon a chassis, with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds, and designed for carrying up to 90 students. The engine is often behind the windshield and beside the driver's seat (referred to as forward control or \"FC\" (sometimes referred to as forward-engine or \"FE\")), or it may be at the rear of the bus, behind the rear wheels (rear-engine or \"RE\"). The entrance door is ahead of the front wheels.\n All school buses sold for the purpose of transporting students between home and school must be painted the traditional yellow, if this type vehicle is purchased it must pass NYS DOT inspection for designation as a school bus. This bus is designed for carrying up to 25 passengers.\n Buses not intended to transport between home and school for students from kindergarten through grade 12 don't have to follow those rules; these buses are prohibited from use for school children in regular route bus transportation service since they are exempt from all traffic control requirements and devices including stop arms and flashing lights.\n 12 passenger vehicles (i.e. Ford Transit 350 Wagon or similar type vehicles) are not intended to transport between home and school for students from kindergarten through grade 12 and will not pass NYS DOT inspection without acceptable capacity modifications.\n These are vehicles do not conform to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards for school buses and cannot be used to transport students. These are typically cargo vehicles converted into 15-passenger vans with passenger seating. These vans lack the significant safety features of even traditional passenger vehicles.",
      "Passage": "Type C - Chassis type is \"Conventional\"\nThe Type C school bus is what most people imagine when they think of a \"traditional\" school bus. A Type C school bus is often called a \"conventional\" bus, the body is installed upon a flat-back cowl chassis with gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds, designed for carrying up to 78 students. The engine is in front of the windshield and the entrance door is behind the front wheels."

      "Left": "New paragraphs:\nDocument:\nFire on board BBC Xingang\nWhat happened\nThe cargo to be discharged comprised containers and 'project cargo', which consisted of large structures of various shapes and sizes. Some of the cargo had gel-coated surfaces that could be easily damaged, and these components were covered with cloth for protection during transport.\n Sea fastenings (or stoppers) were used to secure the project cargo during sea passage. The stoppers were metal brackets welded to the ship's deck, and they needed to be removed before the cargo could be discharged. To remove the stoppers, oxy-acetylene cutting and gouging techniques were required.\n In preparation for removing the stoppers, the chief mate and deck crew had reviewed the ship's risk assessment for hot work and completed the ship's hot work permit. The master had notified Newcastle port of the intended work and a hot work audit report had been completed by a port representative.\n At about 0600 on 11 December, a work team, including a site supervisor and a boilermaker, from a local engineering firm (Varley) boarded the ship. This team had a current Varley Job Safety and Environmental Analysis (JSEA) for hot work to remove stoppers on board ship and had completed a Varley hot work permit.\n At 0630, the chief mate convened a safety meeting involving the Varley boilermaker and relevant crewmembers. The process of removing the stoppers was discussed along with the safety measures and procedures to be followed. Hot work requirements, including the hot work permits and risk assessments, were reviewed. Individual duties, including that of the fire watch, were explained and assigned. The ship's crew were responsible for providing firefighting equipment (such as extinguishers and hoses) and controls such as the fire watch.\n The fire watch consisted of two crewmembers in contact via VHF radio, one on the tween deck and the other in the lower hold. A small diameter fresh water hose was laid out and a makeshift water spray extinguisher readied for immediate use in the lower hold. Cargo in the lower hold was covered with the transport cloth but was not covered with fire blankets.\n At 1015, the boilermaker began removing the stoppers. The port captain asked that sparks be directed away from the cargo to protect the component surfaces. This request, in some cases, resulted in the sparks being directed toward gaps between the tween deck pontoons.",
      "Right": "An inspection of the work site following the fire identified that molten metal and other hot material produced by the hot work had burned through the fire blankets. This hot material fell onto the material covering the cargo in the lower hold, resulting in the fire. As a result of the fire, the material covering the cargo was damaged and some surface blemishes were apparent on the cargo itself (Figure 4). No other damage was reported.\n Following the fire, all work to remove the stoppers was suspended and the incident was reviewed. Procedures and safety measures were reassessed during a meeting of ship's crew and the shore contract team. The cutting procedure was amended to direct the sparks away from deck openings and containment of sparks around the work area was improved. Further, additional filling material was added to holes in the tween decks used for removable hand rails, and the lower hold fire watch was directed to monitor the area directly below the work rather than the general vicinity. Work resumed at 1315 and continued to completion without further incident.\n BBC Xingang\nBBC Xingang is a multi-purpose, heavy lift, general cargo ship registered in Antigua and Barbuda. The ship was built in 2013 by Tianjin Xingang Shipbuilding Heavy Industry, China and classed with DNV GL.\n The ship has an overall length of 125.8 m, a moulded breadth of 22.0 m and a deadweight of 8,970 t at its summer draught of 7.60 m. The multi-purpose ship can carry containers and/or general cargo. It has two cargo holds with tween decks. Two 350 t capacity cranes are mounted on the port side and can be used in combination to lift loads up to 700 t.\n At the time of the incident, BBC Xingang was owned by Briese Schiffahrts 'Hatshausen', operated by BBC Chartering & Logistics and managed by Briese Schiffahrts, all of Germany.\n Previous incidents\nIn the BBC Baltic fire, flammable cargo coverings were also found to have ignited. The damage caused was considerably more than that sustained on BBC Xingang.\n As a consequence of the previous incidents, Briese Schiffahrts had completed significant safety actions, which were in place at the time of the current fire. These included improved shipboard procedures, risk assessments, permits to work, safety meetings and provision of equipment such as fire blankets and mats.",
      "Passage": "The work continued as expected and, at 1100, the boilermaker stopped to relocate to the next stoppers on the tween deck. As part of checking the new work area, he lifted a fire blanket and could see small flames and smoke in the lower hold through the gap in the tween deck pontoons. He immediately raised the alarm. The lower hold fire watch was notified on the radio. At the time he was notified he was not near the area directly under where the work was being conducted. After moving to the relevant area, he quickly extinguished the fire using the water hose and water spray."

      "Outcome5": "The man was using a torch to cut some metal pieces on the floor. He had to be careful because the torch made sparks that could start a fire. He had some friends watching for fire and they had water ready to put it out. But some of the sparks went into a hole in the floor and landed on some cloth that was covering some big things in the room below. The cloth caught fire and made smoke. The man saw the smoke and told his friends. One of his friends went down and used the water to stop the fire.",
      "Outcome6": "As the work progressed, the boilermaker stopped at 1100 to move to a different location on the tween deck where more stoppers needed to be removed.

He immediately alerted the other workers and raised the alarm. The fire watch in the lower hold, who had been monitoring a different area of the hold, responded to the radio call and rushed to the source of the fire. He quickly used the water hose and a water spray extinguisher that were available in the hold to put out the fire.",

This test states that the focal point in deciding whether an individual is an employee or contractor is whether the individual is economically dependent on the business to which he/she renders service or is, as a matter of economic fact, in business for him/herself. In applying this test, the courts generally focus on five (5) factors:\n- the degree of control exerted by the alleged employer over the worker;\n- the worker's opportunity for profit or loss;\n- the worker's investment in the business;\n- the permanence of the working relationship;\n- the degree of skill required to perform the work.\n In addition to the factors stated above, the Department of Labor (DOL) evaluates the following factors to determine whether an individual is truly an independent contractor:\n- the extent to which services rendered are an integral part of the employer's business;\n- the permanency of the relationship (this is a repetition of \"d\" in previous section);\n- the amount of individual investment in facilities and equipment;\n- the opportunities for profit and loss (this is a repetition of \"b\" in previous section);\n- the degree of initiative, judgment, or foresight exercised by the individual who performs the services.\n The Department of Labor (DOL) and the courts have the authority to determine whether individuals are employees or independent contractors in disputes over the applicability of the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act and to grant back pay as required.\n Simply calling a relationship \"contract labor\" does not make it so. All aspects of the actual working relationship must be evaluated to determine if Gettysburg College has the right to exercise direction and control.\n To assist in assessing each situation, departments/managers/directors should use the following attachments. Please contact the Assistant Controller for additional assistance.\n Assessment Form #1 is a quick test to determine an independent contractor relationship.

Due to the lack of appropriate instruments, few studies have examined the development of this ability among children. Method: This study tested the measurement properties of the self-rating and other-rating forms of the Questionnaire of Executive Functioning (QEF), designed to tap children's knowledge of their executive functioning. Specifically, the construct, convergent, and discriminant validities were investigated and a self-other discrepancy score was computed to assess children's executive self-awareness. Participants were 317 children aged 7 to 14 years old. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses carried out on the QEF confirmed the eight-factor structure of both versions. There were significant correlations between the QEF and the parent versions of the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, the Dysexecutive Questionnaire for Children, and the Childhood Executive Functioning Inventory. Both forms of the QEF were able to distinguish between children who had sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and control participants. A statistical difference was observed between the TBI and control groups on this score, suggesting that TBI may trigger self-awareness impairments in children. Conclusion: The good psychometric properties of the two forms of the QEF were established. Furthermore, results of the analyses carried out on the different discrepancy scores seem to indicate that the QEF could help clinicians to detect patients with self-awareness deficits.

      "Right": "Many instruments have been constructed to appraise adults' self-awareness abilities in various cognitive, behavioral, and affective domains. Each of these instruments allows practitioners to compute an index of self-awareness by comparing participants' ratings of their cognitive skills to family member's or clinician's ratings. However, although numerous instruments are available to assess adults' cognitive self-awareness, only a limited number of tools have been developed to assess children's knowledge of their own cognitive functioning. In addition, the few questionnaires available for children generally have poor (or not fully investigated) psychometric properties. For instance, the six-factor model of the Subjective Awareness of Neuropsychological Deficits Questionnaire for Children (SAND-C; Hufford & Fastenau, 2005) - a questionnaire assessing children's knowledge of their attentional, psychomotor, visuospatial, language, memory, and executive functioning - is only weakly supported by the confirmatory factor analysis. Similarly, the psychometric properties of the junior version of the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI Jr; Sperling, Howard, Miller, & Murphy, 2002) - a questionnaire assessing children's knowledge of general cognitive functioning - have not been fully investigated. Moreover, these two questionnaires only come in a self-rating form, making it difficult to compare children's self-assessment of their cognitive abilities with an external quantitative standard. In addition, to our knowledge, neither of these questionnaires is designed to evaluate the cognitive self-awareness of children under the age of 9. Moreover, no self-awareness indexes are available for these scales (Naglieri & Goldstein, 2012; Wilson Donders, & Nguyen, 2011).\n From a theoretical point of view, the absence of validated, age-adapted instruments may explain why the developmental trajectory of children's self-awareness abilities has attracted very little attention so far. To date, the limited available data seem to indicate that self-awareness improves significantly during childhood - particularly between the ages of 6 and 11 - and continues to develop more subtly throughout adolescence and adulthood (Fritz, Howie, & Kleitman, 2010; Kreutzer, Leonard, & Flavell 1975; Pressley & Schneider, 1997). However, a better understanding of the development of children's knowledge of their own cognitive functioning could have important implications on both theoretical and practical grounds. 2008;",
      "Passage": "Cognitive self-awareness is typically defined as the ability to perceive and understand one's own cognitive strengths and limitations (Flavell, 1979; Kennedy & Coelho, 2005; Morris & Mograbi, 2013; Toglia & Kirk, 2000). Generally, people with an accurate representation of their own cognitive functioning are expected to be more likely to make use of appropriate strategies to regulate their cognitive activities in daily life (Ownsworth, McFarland, & Young, 2002), resulting in better cognitive performance (Schneider, 2008). Self-awareness is usually evaluated by comparing participants' ratings of their cognitive skills to an external/objective standard, such as a family member's or clinician's ratings or the participant's performance on neuropsychological tests. The discrepancy score between the self-rating and the standard is classically used as an index of the level of self-awareness (Allen & Ruff, 1990; Fleming, Strong, & Ashton, 1996; Ranseen, Bohaska, & Schmitt, 1990; Sherer, Bergloff, Boake, High, & Levin, 1998)."

Other people do not know themselves very well. They may think they are good at something, but they are not. Or they may think they are bad at something, but they are not. Knowing yourself well is important because it can help you to learn better and to make good choices. We call this ability self-awareness.\n\nWe wanted to see how children like you learn to know themselves better as they grow up. We also wanted to see how children who have hurt their brains may have trouble with self-awareness. So we made a special quiz for children to answer some questions about how they think and do things. We also asked their parents or teachers to answer the same questions about them. Then we compared the answers to see how well the children knew themselves.",

This representation can guide and regulate one's cognitive activities in everyday situations, leading to better cognitive performance and outcomes (Ownsworth, McFarland, & Young, 2002; Schneider, 2008). A common method to evaluate the level of cognitive self-awareness is to compare how individuals rate their own cognitive skills with an external or objective criterion, such as the ratings of a family member or a clinician or the scores on neuropsychological tests. The degree of discrepancy between the self-rating and the criterion reflects the accuracy or inaccuracy of the individual's self-awareness (Allen & Ruff, 1990; Fleming, Strong, & Ashton, 1996; Ranseen, Bohaska, & Schmitt, 1990; Sherer et al., 1998).",

You must have a disability or health condition which stops you being able to do parts of your job and this must be likely to last for 12 months or more.\n How Access to Work can help\nAccess to Work can pay towards any specialist equipment you may need, for adapting premises to meet your needs, or a support worker. It can also pay towards the cost of getting to and from work if the you are unable to use public transport.\n If you think you may be eligible for support under the Access to Work programme, you will need to submit an application. Applications are taken by telephone - call 0208 426 3110 (textphone is 0208 4263133) and a form will be sent for you to sign and return. Once returned, the application will be allocated to an adviser in your area.\n The Access to Work adviser will contact you and conduct an appraisal of your needs. The adviser will also need to speak to your line manager. In most cases this can be done by telephone but a visit may be necessary and can be arranged, if requested by you.\n Specialist advice may be required in some circumstances and the Access to Work adviser will help to arrange this. For example, the adviser may arrange for a specialist organisation to complete a technical or work station assessment in order to recommend appropriate support.\n The Medway Council Black Workers Forum (MCBWF) is made up of non-white employees of the council.

      "Left": "If death in itself is final , here it comes with a lightness , a softness , also pointing to \" an acceptance of process beyond the possibility of grief . \" The progress of growth is no longer necessary ; maturation is complete , and life and death are in harmony . The rich description of the cycle of the seasons enables the reader to feel a belonging \" to something larger than the self \" , as James O 'Rourke expresses it , but the cycle comes to an end each year , analogous to the ending of single life . O 'Rourke suggests that something of a fear of that ending is subtly implied at the end of the poem , although , unlike the other great odes , in this poem the person of the poet is entirely submerged , so there is at most a faint hint of Keats 's own possible fear .\n According to Helen Vendler , \" To Autumn \" may be seen as an allegory of artistic creation . As the farmer processes the fruits of the soil into what sustains the human body , so the artist processes the experience of life into a symbolic structure that may sustain the human spirit . This process involves an element of self-sacrifice by the artist , analogous to the living grain 's being sacrificed for human consumption . In \" To Autumn \" , as a result of this process , the \" rhythms \" of the harvesting \" artist-goddess \" \" permeate the whole world until all visual , tactile , and kinetic presence is <unk> into Apollonian music for the ear , \" the sounds of the poem itself .\n In a 1979 essay , Jerome McGann argued that while the poem was indirectly influenced by historical events , Keats had deliberately ignored the political landscape of 1819 . Countering this view , Andrew Bennett , Nicholas Roe and others focused on what they believed were political allusions actually present in the poem , Roe arguing for a direct connection to the Peterloo Massacre of 1819 . Later , Paul Fry argued against McGann 's stance when he pointed out , \" It scarcely seems pertinent to say that ' To Autumn ' is therefore an evasion of social violence when it is so clearly an encounter with death itself [ ... ] it is not a politically encoded escape from history reflecting the coerced betrayal [ ... ] of its author 's radicalism . McGann thinks to rescue Keats from the imputation of political naïveté by saying that he was a radical browbeaten into quietism \" .",
      "Right": "According to Bewell , the landscape of \" To Autumn \" presents the temperate climate of rural England as a healthful alternative to disease-ridden foreign environments . Though the \" clammy \" aspect of \" fever \" , the excessive ripeness associated with tropical climates , intrude into the poem , these elements , less prominent than in Keats 's earlier poetry , are counterbalanced by the dry , crisp autumnal air of rural England . In presenting the particularly English elements of this environment , Keats was also influenced by contemporary poet and essayist Leigh Hunt , who had recently written of the arrival of autumn with its \" migration of birds \" , \" finished harvest \" , \" cyder [ ... ] making \" and migration of \" the swallows \" , as well as by English landscape painting and the \" pure \" English idiom of the poetry of Thomas Chatterton .\n In \" To Autumn \" , Bewell argues , Keats was at once voicing \" a very personal expression of desire for health \" and constructing a \" myth of a national environment \" . This \" political \" element in the poem , Bewell points out , has also been suggested by Geoffrey Hartman , who expounded a view of \" To Autumn \" as \" an ideological poem whose form expresses a national idea \" .\n Thomas McFarland , on the other hand , in 2000 cautioned against overemphasizing the \" political , social , or historical readings \" of the poem , which distract from its \" consummate surface and bloom \" . Most important about \" To Autumn \" is its concentration of imagery and allusion in its evocation of nature , conveying an \" interpenetration of <unk> and <unk> as contained in the very nature of autumn \" .",

      "Outcome1": "Alan Bewell, in his 1999 study of British literature and colonial climates, argued that \"To Autumn\" reflects Keats's awareness of the health risks of tropical environments. He suggested that Keats portrayed the temperate English landscape as a safe and desirable alternative to the foreign lands that threatened disease and death. Bewell also noted that Keats drew on the writings of Leigh Hunt and the paintings of English artists to emphasize the national identity of his autumnal scene. Thus, \"To Autumn\" was not only a personal expression of Keats's longing for health, but also a political statement of his attachment to his homeland.",
      "Outcome2": "Instead of \" the landscape of ' To Autumn ' \" , Bewell examines how the poem depicts \" a distinctive climatic zone of rural England \" as a contrast to the perilous and disease-ridden environments of the colonies . Keats 's medical background , his own experience of chronic illness , and his exposure to \" colonial medical discourse \" made him keenly aware of this contrast . The poem still contains traces of the \" sticky \" quality of \" fever \" and the overabundant ripeness that characterizes tropical climates , but they are less dominant than in Keats 's earlier poetry , and are offset by the dry , crisp autumnal air of the English countryside . Keats also draws on the contemporary writings of Leigh Hunt , who had recently celebrated the arrival of autumn with its specific features such as \" bird migration \" , \" completed harvest \" , \" cider [ ... ] production \" and departure of \" the swallows \" , as well as on English landscape painting and the poetic language of Thomas Chatterton , to emphasize the uniquely English aspects of this environment .",
      "Outcome3": "Building on the idea that the poem reflects Keats's awareness of the dangers of foreign climates, Alan Bewell, in his 1999 study of the effect on British literature of the diseases and climates of the colonies, read \"the landscape of 'To Autumn'\" as \"a kind of biomedical allegory of the coming into being of English climatic space out of its dangerous geographical alternatives.\" Britain's colonial reach over the previous century and a half had exposed the mother country to foreign diseases and awareness of the dangers of extreme tropical climates.

      "Outcome4": "For Alan Bewell , a 1999 scholar of British colonial literature and disease , \" To Autumn \" shows Keats 's awareness of the health risks of foreign climates and his preference for England 's temperate environment . The poem contrasts the \" clammy \" and overripe aspects of the tropics with the crisp autumn air of rural England , drawing on Leigh Hunt 's essays , English landscape painting , and Thomas Chatterton 's poetry . Keats thus expresses both his personal longing for health and his nationalistic vision of a pure English landscape .",
      "Outcome5": "Keats wrote this poem when he was sick and he missed his home in England. He thought England had a nice weather that made him feel better. He also liked the things that happened in England when autumn came, like the birds flying away, the farmers picking fruits, and the people making apple juice. He learned about these things from his friend and from some pictures and poems. He wanted to show how pretty and good England was in autumn.",
      "Outcome6": "One possible approach to interpreting \"To Autumn\" is to see it as a representation of the relationship between Britain and its colonies, as Alan Bewell suggested in his 1999 study of how colonial diseases and climates affected British literature. According to Bewell, Keats was keenly aware of the health risks posed by exposure to foreign environments, as he had experienced chronic illness himself and had a medical background that made him familiar with \"colonial medical discourse\". In contrast to the earlier poems of Keats, which often depicted the allure and danger of tropical landscapes, \"To Autumn\" celebrates the moderate and salubrious climate of rural England as a source of well-being and artistic inspiration. Bewell argues that Keats deliberately included some hints of the \"clammy\" aspects of \"fever\", such as the overripe fruits and the gnats, but that these are outweighed by the dry and crisp images of autumnal nature, such as the stubble fields, the cider press, and the swallows. To create this impression of a distinctively English environment, Keats drew on various influences, such as Leigh Hunt's essays on autumnal scenes, English landscape painting, and Thomas Chatterton's poetry in an archaic English idiom. By doing so, Bewell claims, Keats was not only expressing his personal desire for health and recovery, but also constructing a \"myth of a national environment\" that could serve as a cultural identity for Britain in contrast to its colonial others. This aspect of \"To Autumn\" has also been noted by Geoffrey Hartman, who viewed the poem as an expression of a national idea through its form.",

We highlight the work of the OAS in institutional strengthening and support for the design and execution of public policies in different areas.\n The member states of the OAS must commit to finding effective and immediate solutions for the financing of the OAS and the institutions created during the entire process of shaping the inter-American human rights system (Court and Commission), as well as other mechanisms for the protection of human rights, created under the aegis of the OAS. Otherwise, advances in human rights in our region in recent years will be ignored, and the records of democratic restriction and violation of rights will be reinstated in our continent.\n We reaffirm the Platform for the Development of the Americas (PLADA) as an instrument for development that is not only economic, but also socially and environmentally sustainable. The PLADA expresses that a sustainable development will only be possible from an effective popular participation of the workers, the young people, the women and the various movements and social organizations. That allows promoting economic growth with effective distribution of wealth, respecting human rights, gender equality, decent work, free movement of people, and protection and social inclusion.\n We believe that this OAS Assembly in Washington should send an important signal that there is a commitment in our region to formulate policies that effectively advance the achievement of sustainable development and the defense of trade union and labor rights, that are human rights, and maintain a relationship of interdependence with other human rights. For this reason, guaranteeing the full exercise of trade union rights is the main pillar for an alternative model of development in all the countries of our hemisphere.\n We recognize the importance of the spaces that have been created in the OAS to give us prominence as democratic and development actors. Strengthening the interlocution of COSATE and the work of the Executive Secretariat for Integral Development (SEDI), through the Labor and Employment Section to facilitate this task, is of particular interest to the union of the Americas in the future. Likewise, the continuity of the work undertaken by the Inter-American Network for Labor Administration (RIAL).",

His 20 triples and 264 total bases were both the fifth-highest total in a season for the Cardinals franchise from between the years of 1892 when they entered the NL to 1920 , which marked the end of the Dead-ball era . At the end of the year , he had played 133 games , two behind Major League leader and teammate , Joe Quinn . Offensively , Cooley tied for seventh in most hits and finished fourth in triples .\n At the beginning of the 1896 season , Cooley continued to play for the Browns . However , after 40 games in which he had a .307 batting average , he was moved to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for Joe Sullivan , Tuck Turner , and an unknown sum of money . The Phillies , under manager Billy Nash , finished 62 – 68 , eighth in the NL .

Cooley led his team in runs scored and stolen bases , and finished third , behind Ed Delahanty and Nap Lajoie , in hits .

He also compiled 30 runs , 50 hits , and 22 RBI .\n After being purchased by the Boston Beaneaters in 1901 , Cooley made his minor-league debut for the Syracuse Stars of Syracuse , New York . After recording a team-high in batting average and slugging percentage , Cooley was promoted to the Major League Beaneaters .

The Austrians were low on ammunition , cut off from Ulm , and completely demoralized by the confusion reigning at army headquarters .",
      "Right": "Events at Ulm were now reaching a conclusion . On 15 October Ney 's troops successfully charged the Michelsberg encampments and on the 16th the French began to bombard Ulm itself . Austrian morale was at a low point and Mack began to realize that there was little hope of rescue . On 17 October Napoleon 's emissary , Ségur , signed a convention with Mack in which the Austrians agreed to surrender on 25 October if no aid came by that date . Gradually , however , Mack heard of the capitulations at Heidenheim and Neresheim and agreed to surrender five days before schedule on 20 October . Fifteen hundred troops from the Austrian garrison managed to escape , but the vast majority of the Austrian force marched out on 21 October and laid down their arms without incident , all with the Grande Armée drawn up in a vast semicircle observing the capitulation ( see infobox picture ) . The officers were permitted to leave , pending their signatures on a parole in which they agreed not to take up arms against France until they were exchanged . More than ten general officers were included in this agreement , including Mack , Johann von Klenau , Maximilian Anton Karl , Count Baillet de Latour , Prince Liechtenstein , and Ignaz Gyulai .",

The Austrian command also suffered from discord as Ferdinand overruled Mack and ordered all cavalry to evacuate Ulm, a total of 6,000 troopers. Murat chased them so relentlessly, however, that only eleven squadrons reached Werneck at Heidenheim. Murat continued his pressure on Werneck and compelled him to surrender with 8,000 men at <unk> on 19 October.

      "Outcome5": "Some more things happened on the next day. Murat and Dupont were friends and they met at a place called Albeck. They saw some Austrians who wanted to fight them, but they worked together and chased them away to another place called Heidenheim. When it was dark, Murat and Dupont were very close to where the Austrians were sleeping at a hill near Ulm. Mack was the leader of the Austrians and he was very worried: he could not run away to the north because there were more French there, he could not run away to the south because Soult was coming from that way, and he could not stay in Ulm because Marmont and some special French soldiers were waiting for him there. Mack did not know what to do and he was very sad. He also had a problem with Ferdinand, who was another Austrian leader. Ferdinand told him to send all his horses away from Ulm, but Murat was so fast that he caught most of them on the way. Murat did not stop there, he kept following the Austrians who ran away and made them give up at a place called <unk>. He also took many of their carts and things. Then he went to another place called Neustadt and made more Austrians give up.",
      "Outcome6": "On the next day , 14 October , more fighting ensued . Murat 's cavalry force joined Dupont 's infantry division at Albeck , where they encountered an Austrian attack led by Werneck . The French troops fought off the Austrians and pushed them back to the north in the direction of Heidenheim , where they hoped to join Mack 's main army . By nightfall on the 14th , two French corps under Ney and Lannes were stationed close to the Austrian encampments at Michelsberg , a hill that overlooked Ulm from the north . Mack found himself in a perilous situation : he had no chance of breaking out to the north bank of the Danube , where Marmont and the Imperial Guard were blocking his way ; he could not retreat to the south of the river , where Soult was advancing from Memmingen to cut off his escape route to the Tyrol ; and he faced constant pressure from Murat 's cavalry and Ney 's and Lannes ' infantry . To make matters worse , Mack lost control of his army as Ferdinand overruled his orders and commanded that all cavalry should leave Ulm and join Werneck 's force . Murat 's pursuit was so relentless , however , that only a fraction of the Austrian horsemen managed to reach Heidenheim . Murat continued to harass Werneck until he forced him to surrender with 8,000 men at <unk> on 19 October ; in addition , Murat captured an entire Austrian field park of 500 wagons and carts . He then moved on towards Neustadt an der Donau , where he took another 12,000 Austrians prisoner.",

      "Outcome1": "Firstly, the predominant source of energy today is water. However, water scarcity limits the potential of generating electricity from this source, and many countries still depend exclusively on it. To produce enough power, the essential resources are running out. As a result, during summer there are frequent power outages in the developing countries such as India. If the government promotes the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy, it might solve the problem of uneven power distribution. Therefore, it would be a beneficial policy by the government to diversify the sources of electricity generation.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the reasons why other resources such as nuclear and solar are preferable to water is that they can overcome the problem of water scarcity and power shortage. To generate such a vast energy, the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the main reasons to explore other energy sources is the scarcity of water. Water is the primary source of energy today, but many countries face a lot of water shortage to generate electricity. For instance, in developing countries like India, power cuts are common during summer due to low water levels. However, these problems could be avoided if the government promotes the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy as alternatives. Thus, diversifying the energy sources would be a beneficial policy for ensuring adequate power supply.",
      "Outcome4": "Water is the main energy source today, but it is scarce and insufficient. Many countries face power cuts in summer due to this. Using nuclear, solar or wind energy could solve this problem. The government should promote these alternative sources of power.",
      "Outcome5": "Water is used to make electricity for many people. But sometimes there is not enough water and people do not have enough electricity. This makes them unhappy. There are other ways to make electricity that do not need water. They use things like the sun, the wind, or a special kind of metal. These ways can make more electricity and make people happy. The government should help people use these ways more.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main challenges of the modern world is to meet the increasing energy demand of the growing population and the technological progress. The traditional source of energy, which is water, is becoming insufficient and unsustainable for many reasons. For instance, many countries face water scarcity and droughts that limit their ability to generate hydroelectric power. Moreover, building dams and reservoirs can have negative impacts on the environment and the local communities. Therefore, it is essential to explore and utilize other sources of energy that are more abundant and eco-friendly, such as nuclear, solar or wind energy. These sources can provide a reliable and clean supply of electricity without depending on water availability or causing environmental damage.",

      "Left": "You should note that you have the right to change the start date of your maternity leave provided that you give at least 28 days written notice of the change.\n Note on the MAT B1 certificate\nThe MAT B1 is a form signed by a doctor/midwife confirming your expected week of childbirth (EWC). Hospitals and GP surgeries have different policies regarding when the MAT B1 should be signed and by whom. The MAT B1 is not always issued automatically and you may have to ask your doctor/midwife for a copy.\n Ante-natal Care\nDuring your pregnancy, your doctor/midwife will make regular appointments with you for ante-natal checks, scans, tests etc. You are entitled to take reasonable time off work to attend these appointments, regardless of your length of service or the hours that you work. This time off will be paid and you will not be expected to make up the time. You should, however, give your manager as much notice as possible of your appointments and, after the first one, should show them the appointment card from the hospital or clinic.\n Maternity leave\nYou are entitled to take up to 52 weeks' maternity leave. This is made up of 26 weeks of ordinary maternity leave (OML) plus 26 weeks' additional maternity leave (AML). You also have the right to return to work after the end of your OML or AML. This right applies to all female employees regardless of length of service or the number of hours worked per week.\n You can choose when to start your maternity leave. This can be any date from the beginning of the 11th week before the week the baby is due. The law requires that an employee take a minimum of two weeks maternity leave immediately following the birth.\n Sick leave during your pregnancy or maternity leave\nIf you are off sick due to a pregnancy-related illness any time after the beginning of the fourth week before the start of the expected week of childbirth (EWC), then your maternity leave period will begin straight away.\n If you are off sick due to a non pregnancy-related illness any time after the beginning of the fourth week before the start of the expected week of childbirth (EWC), it will be treated as sick leave in the usual way.\n Any pregnancy-related sick leave taken before the start of the fourth week will be treated as sick leave in the usual way.\n Early births",
      "Right": "Maternity pay\nYou are eligible to receive 39 weeks statutory maternity pay (SMP) if:\nyou have at least 26 weeks' continuous service by the end of the 15th week before the expected week of childbirth (EWC) ('the qualifying week')\n you have average weekly earnings in the eight weeks up to and including the qualifying week of at least the lower earnings limit for Class 1 National Insurance contributions.\n If you qualify for SMP, it will usually be paid for a period of up to 39 weeks. Rates are fixed by law and are subject to tax and National Insurance deductions. During the first six weeks of this 39 week period, SMP is paid at 90% of your average weekly earnings; thereafter you will receive the weekly lower statutory maternity rate or 90% of your weekly earnings, whichever is the lesser amount.\n If you do not qualify for SMP you may be eligible to receive maternity allowance. You should contact your local Job Centre for details of this benefit.\n Shared parental leave (SPL)\nYou are entitled to curtail your maternity leave and pay and instead take SPL and pay with your partner/the father of the child, subject to meeting the eligibility criteria. SPL enables parents to choose how to share the care of their child during the first year of birth. Its purpose is to give parents more flexibility in considering how to best care for, and bond with, their child. See the shared parental leave policy.\n The effect of maternity leave on contractual benefits\nDuring your maternity leave you will be entitled to receive the contractual benefits that you would normally receive if you were at work with the exception of cash benefits (eg remuneration and allowances).\n On return to work following OML and AML you are entitled to benefit from any general improvements to the rate of pay (or other terms and conditions) that you would have received had you been at work. This may also lead to a re-calculation of your SMP entitlements.\n Your contractual annual leave entitlement continues to accrue during your maternity leave. You can choose to take any leave accrued, as a block, either before you commence maternity leave, immediately upon your return to work or a combination of the two. You should be aware that if you take the annual leave before starting maternity leave and then leave employment mid-way through the maternity leave, the usual deductions will apply from your final salary or we may ask for an appropriate refund.",

Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.",

They claim that teachers instruct students on the basic skills of writing, reading and calculating from an early age. They also help them acquire more advanced knowledge, such as how to use computers and improve their writing skills, when they reach primary school. Furthermore, teachers assist students in overcoming difficulties and challenges in their education. Therefore, most of the knowledge and values that students learn come from teachers.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the main debates about learning is whether students benefit more from lessons with teachers or from other sources, such as the Internet and television. Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.",
      "Outcome3": "Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They cite some studies that show that teachers have a significant impact on students' academic achievement and motivation (Hattie, 2009; Ryan & Deci, 2000). They also point out that teachers teach students essential skills and knowledge, such as literacy, numeracy and digital competence, from an early age. Teachers also guide students to overcome challenges and difficulties in their learning process. On the other hand, students acquire most of their knowledge through teachers and learn how to distinguish between right and wrong with the help of teachers.",
      "Outcome4": "However, some people think that students still learn more from teachers' lessons. They say that teachers guide students from basic to advanced skills, such as reading, writing and computing. Teachers also help students overcome difficulties and teach them morals. Students mainly acquire knowledge and values from teachers.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people think that students learn a lot from their teachers. They say that teachers help students learn how to do things like writing, reading and math when they are very young. And when they grow up a little, teachers teach them more things, like how to write better and how to use computers. It is teachers that help them when they have problems in school. Also, students get most of their knowledge from teachers and learn how to behave well with their help.",
      "Outcome6": "However, many people still hold the view that students at schools and universities benefit more from lessons with teachers than from other sources. They point out that teachers are the ones who teach students the basic skills of writing, reading and calculating when they are in kindergarten. And as they progress to primary school, teachers impart them more advanced knowledge, such as how to write effectively and how to use computers properly. Teachers also play a crucial role in helping students overcome difficulties and challenges in their learning process. Furthermore, they maintain that students acquire most of their knowledge through teachers' guidance and instruction, and also learn how to distinguish right from wrong with the help of teachers' feedback and evaluation.",

      "Outcome3": "One of the advantages that professionals or students have by connecting from home is the convenience it offers. Firstly, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. A good example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. Secondly, people also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is a beneficial option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Therefore, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.",
      "Outcome4": "Working or studying from home has many benefits. It allows professionals to balance work and family, such as new mothers who can care for their babies. It also offers flexibility in working hours. Students can save time by avoiding travel to universities and focus on their studies. Tokyo students, for example, face long commutes. Hence, people enjoy working or studying from home.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people like to do their work or school at home. They think this is good for them. They can spend more time with their family and do things when they want to. For example, a mommy who has a baby can work at home and look after her baby too. Some kids like to learn at home because they don't have to go far away to school. They can use the time to study more. So, working or learning at home makes some people happy.",
      "Outcome6": "On the one hand, there are many advantages that professionals or students can enjoy by connecting from home through internet. For one, it helps working people to achieve a better balance between their work and personal life. The most suitable example is the new mother who can resume her work without compromising her baby's care. People also have the freedom to choose their own working hours according to their convenience. For students too, studying from home is a beneficial option. They avoid the hassle of travelling to Universities and use that time more effectively on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students face a lot of traffic congestion and waste precious time in commuting. Therefore, the benefits that people gain by working or studying from home are evident.",

      "Left": "Khrushchev 's proposal to expand cooperative ownership ran contrary to the Marxist theory as interpreted by Stalin . Suslov , who supported Stalin 's economic policy , regarded Khrushchev 's proposal as unacceptable on ideological grounds . In an election speech to the Supreme Soviet in March 1958 , Suslov refused to recognise the ideological significance of Khrushchev 's reform , preferring instead to focus on the reform 's practical benefits in improving productivity . Unlike other Party leaders , Suslov avoided mentioning Khrushchev as the MTS reform 's initiator .\n The 21st Party Congress convened in January 1959 . Khrushchev wanted to consider the draft of a new Seven-Year plan . Suslov cautiously demonstrated against Khrushchev 's statement that the country had developed from the socialist state of development to the higher state of communist development . He saw Khrushchev 's view as flawed , and countered that his view had not been approved by the Party . To discredit Khrushchev 's assertion further , Suslov deferred to Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin : \n \" Marx and Lenin teach us that communism doesn 't appear suddenly , but comes into existence , matures , develops , passes in its development through definite stages or phases .... The new period in the development of Soviet society will be marked by the gradual drawing together of two forms of socialist property – state and kolkhoz ... The process of these social changes will be long , and understandably , cannot end in the course of a seven year period . \" \n  Suslov was becoming progressively more critical of Khrushchev 's policies , his political intransigence , and his campaign to eliminate what was left of the old Stalinist guard . There were also deep-seated divergences in foreign and domestic policy between Suslov and Khrushchev . Suslov opposed the idea of improving Soviet – United States relations , and was against Khrushchev 's attempts at rapprochement with Yugoslavia . Domestically , Suslov opposed Khrushchev 's policy of de-Stalinisation and his economic decentralisation scheme .\n Suslov visited the United Kingdom in 1959 as a parliamentarian for the Supreme Soviet . The visit was a success , and Hugh Gaitskell , the Leader of the Labour Party , travelled to the Soviet Union later that year as a guest .",
      "Right": "In the years following the failure of the Anti-Party Group , Suslov became the leader of the opposition faction in the Central Committee , known as the \" Moscow faction \" , to Khrushchev 's leadership . Khrushchev was able to hold on to power by conceding to various opposition demands in times of crisis , such as during the 1960 U-2 incident and the Cuban Missile Crisis . In the aftermath of the U-2 Crisis Suslov was able to remove , and replace , several of Khrushchev 's appointees in the Politburo with new anti-<unk> members . Khrushchev 's position was greatly weakened after the failure of the Cuban Missile Crisis , and Suslov 's power greatly increased . A campaign to oust Khrushchev from office was initiated in 1964 . Although leader of the opposition , Suslov had fallen seriously ill during his trip to the People 's Republic of China the previous year ; instead , Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin led the opposition .",
      "Passage": "Sino – Soviet relations had long been strained , and as Suslov told the Central Committee in one his reports , \" The crux of the matter is that the Leadership of the CCP has recently developed tendencies to exaggerate the degree of maturity of socialist relations in China ... There are elements of conceit and haughtiness . [ These shortcomings ] are largely explained by the atmosphere of the cult of personality of comrade Mao Zedong ... who , by all accounts , himself has come to believe in his own infallibility . \" Suslov compared Mao 's growing personality cult with that seen under Joseph Stalin ."

[These shortcomings] are largely explained by the atmosphere of the cult of personality of comrade Mao Zedong ... who, by all accounts, himself has come to believe in his own infallibility.\" Suslov compared Mao's growing authoritarianism with that seen under Joseph Stalin.\n\nSuslov also emerged as the leader of the anti-Khrushchev faction within the Soviet party, known as the \"Moscow faction\". He opposed Khrushchev's policies on de-Stalinisation, economic reform, and foreign relations. He especially disapproved of Khrushchev's attempts to improve ties with the United States and Yugoslavia. Suslov exploited Khrushchev's failures in international crises, such as the U-2 incident and the Cuban Missile Crisis, to undermine his authority and replace his loyalists in the Politburo with anti-Khrushchev members. In 1964, he supported a coup against Khrushchev led by Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin.",
      "Outcome3": "Relations between China and the Soviet Union had been tense for a long time, and as the Central Committee heard from one of his reports, \"The main problem is that the CCP Leadership has recently shown tendencies to overestimate the level of maturity of socialist relations in China ... There are signs of arrogance and pride. [These flaws] are largely explained by the atmosphere of the personality cult of comrade Mao Zedong ... who, apparently, himself has come to believe in his own infallibility.\" The opposition leader compared Mao's growing cult of personality with that seen under Joseph Stalin.",
      "Outcome4": "As Suslov reported to the Central Committee , China 's leaders were overconfident and arrogant , and Mao Zedong had a cult of personality similar to Stalin . Suslov disapproved of Mao 's infallibility claim .",
      "Outcome5": "There was a big country called China that was friends with the Soviet Union. But then they started to disagree about some things. Suslov thought that China's leader, Mao, was acting like he was the best and could do no wrong. Suslov did not like that because he remembered how Stalin acted like that too and it was bad. Suslov told the other leaders in the Soviet Union that Mao was wrong and they should not listen to him.",
      "Outcome6": "Relations between the Soviet Union and China had been deteriorating for a long time, and Suslov was one of the most vocal critics of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership. He accused them of deviating from the Marxist-Leninist principles and pursuing a nationalist and adventurist course. In a report to the Central Committee, Suslov said, \"The root cause of the problem is that the CCP leadership has recently shown tendencies to overestimate the level of development of socialist relations in China ... They display signs of arrogance and self-importance. [These flaws] are largely explained by the atmosphere of the cult of personality around comrade Mao Zedong ... who, apparently, has come to believe in his own infallibility.\" Suslov drew parallels between Mao's growing personality cult and the one that had existed under Joseph Stalin.",

      "Outcome5": "Some of its teeth in the front are very long and thin and they stick out straight. They look like a comb made of teeth. This is called a toothcomb. The lemur uses its toothcomb to clean itself, to pick up small fruits, to pull off leaves from the branches, and to get sticky stuff from the trees. The lemur also has a special part under its tongue that helps it keep its toothcomb clean. The tooth next to the toothcomb is big and pointy like a dog's tooth. It fits with another pointy tooth on the top jaw. There is also some space between some of the teeth in the bottom jaw.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the distinctive features of the ring-tailed lemur's dentition is the presence of a toothcomb , which consists of six teeth in the lower jaw that are modified for grooming and feeding purposes . The first two incisors ( i1 and i2 ) and the canine ( c1 ) on each side of the lower jaw are elongated , slender , and closely spaced , forming a comb-like structure that projects forward from the mouth . These teeth are also incisor-shaped ( incisiform ) , meaning that they have a chisel-like edge for cutting . The toothcomb is used to scrape and lick fur , skin , and nails during oral grooming , as well as to grasp small fruits , strip leaves from stems , and extract sap or gum from tree bark . To keep the toothcomb clean and prevent infections , the ring-tailed lemur has a specialized tongue organ called a sublingual organ . This organ is a thin , flat , fibrous plate that covers most of the base of the tongue and can be extended to brush off any debris from the toothcomb . Behind the toothcomb , there is another modified tooth in the lower jaw : the first premolar ( p2 ) . This tooth is larger than the other premolars and canine-shaped ( caniniform ) , meaning that it has a pointed tip for piercing . It fits into a gap between the upper canine ( C1 ) and the first premolar ( P2 ) when the mouth is closed , acting like a lower canine .

      "Outcome1": "One textual variant in Alexandrinus is found in Luke 4:17, where it reads ἀνοίξας (opened) instead of ἀναπτύξας (unrolled), as in most other manuscripts. This difference may reflect a different understanding of the physical form of the scroll that Jesus read from in the synagogue. While the majority of manuscripts imply that the scroll was rolled up and had to be unrolled to find the passage, Alexandrinus and a few other witnesses suggest that the scroll was already open and Jesus just had to turn to the right place. This variant does not affect the meaning of the passage significantly, but it shows how Alexandrinus sometimes preserves an alternative reading that may reflect an older or more accurate tradition.",
      "Outcome2": "As an example of the textual variations in the New Testament, in Luke 4 : 17 Alexandrinus has textual variant ἀνοίξας ( opened ) together with the manuscripts B , L , W , Ξ , 33 , 892 , 1195 , 1241 , ℓ 547 , syrs , syrh , <unk> , copsa , copbo , against variant ἀναπτύξας ( unrolled ) supported by א , Dc , K , Δ , Θ , Π , Ψ , f1 , f13 , 28 , 565 , 700 , 1009 , 1010 and other manuscripts .",
      "Outcome3": "One notable textual variant in Alexandrinus is found in Luke 4 : 17 , where it reads ἀνοίξας ( opened ) instead of ἀναπτύξας ( unrolled ) for the action of Jesus with the scroll of Isaiah . This variant implies that the scroll was already unrolled to the right place , suggesting a providential guidance or a familiarity of Jesus with the scriptures .",

      "Outcome5": "One time, Jesus went to a place where people had a big book with God's words. He took the book and opened it to find a part that talked about him. Some other books have God's words rolled up like a scroll, but this book had pages that you can turn. He read the words out loud to the people and they listened.",
      "Outcome6": "One textual variant that Alexandrinus has in Luke 4 : 17 is the word ἀνοίξας ( opened ) , which is used to describe how Jesus handled the scroll of Isaiah . This word is also found in the manuscripts B , L , W , Ξ , 33 , 892 , 1195 , 1241 , ℓ 547 , syrs , syrh , <unk> , copsa and copbo . However, most other manuscripts, such as א , Dc , K , Δ , Θ , Π , Ψ , f1, f13, 28, 565, 700, 1009, 1010 and others, have the word ἀναπτύξας ( unrolled ) instead.

      "Left": "New paragraphs:\nDocument:\nRatified by Management Committee: October 2014\nReview date: October 2015\nThe Code applies to AP School employees regardless of the basis of the employment including:\nSecondments (both to and from the School/County Council);\nTemporary assignments (both to and from the School/County Council), Work Placements and Trainees;\nEmployees acting as members of companies or voluntary organisations.\n The purpose of this Code is to give all school employees guidance on how the AP School, County Council and the public in general expect them to behave. High standards are expected of all staff working in schools and if the Code is followed then staff should not find themselves in a situation where their conduct could create an impression of conflict of interest or corruption in the minds of the public and colleagues. If staff are unsure of the standards expected of them guidance should be sought from their Head Teacher or, in the case of the Head Teacher, the Management Committee or the County Council's Operations Director Education, Learning & Libraries.\n The areas covered by this Code are as follows:\nUse of the School's Facilities and Equipment;\nArrest or conviction on civil or criminal charges;\nMembership of clubs, societies and other organisations;\nBreaches of the Code of Conduct.\n School employees are expected to give the highest possible standard of service to the public and to support the Management Committee and fellow employees with impartiality.\n The School, for its part, considers it has a duty to protect employees against unjustified allegations of wrong doing.\n Although the School has not adopted a formal dress code it does expect employees to observe a standard of personal hygiene and appearance which is appropriate to the nature of the work undertaken.",
      "Right": "Culture of the Organisation\nAlthough the School believes that Management Committee, employees and organisations associated with the School will act with honesty and integrity it recognises that occasionally this will not be the case. The School's culture is one of honesty and zero tolerance in respect of fraud and corruption.\n Employees must make themselves aware of and comply with the School's Finance Policy and the Fair Funding Scheme for Financing Schools. In addition the following useful key documents available from the County Council set out various standards of behaviour and procedures in addition to those mentioned in this Code:\nInformation Management and Security policies, procedures and standards;\nEmployees must use public funds entrusted to them in a responsible and lawful manner and ensure that value for money is achieved. They must comply at all times with the Schools and be mindful of the Council's Financial Regulations and associated Accounting Instructions.\n It is a criminal offence for employees to give or receive any *gift, loan, fee, reward or advantage for doing, or not doing anything, or showing favour or disfavour to any person, company or contractor, with a corrupt intention.\n Although there may be no corruptive intention in the act of giving or receiving of gifts, etc it is important to avoid any grounds for suspicion of corruption. For example, where contracts are being negotiated employees should not negotiate with a potential contractor, supplier or purchaser (of land for example) on a one -to- one basis. Employees must ensure that all steps in the contract negotiations should be recorded and that their manager has approved those steps in writing. Standing Orders, Financial Regulations, the Procurement Guidance and the policies of both the School and the Council must always be followed; an adequate audit trail must be maintained.\n The School recognises that a key preventative measure in the fight against fraud and corruption is to take effective steps at the recruitment stage to establish the previous record of potential employees in terms of their propriety and integrity.\n Any personal interests, financial or otherwise, must be registered when they could reasonably be deemed to potentially conflict with any work undertaken by employees in the course of their duties. The Head Teacher will be responsible for ensuring that their personal interests are registered in accordance with this Code and that all of their employees are aware of the need to register personal interests.",
      "Passage": "The School is entitled to expect at least the same standard of care of its property as employees give to their own property. Any facilities, property or equipment provided by the School should only be used in connection with official duties except where the Head Teacher and Management Committee has agreed to private use. There may be arrangements for the use of some services for private purposes on the payment of approved charges e.g. private telephone calls and photocopies, etc. You should always ensure that there is either general or specific agreement to private use of any facility or equipment.\nWhen an employee ceases working for the School all papers and other records, equipment and any other property of the School must be returned."

When employees leave the School, they must return all the School's property that they have in their possession. This paragraph summarises the rules for using the School's facilities and equipment.\n\nAnother expectation that the School has of its employees is that they act honestly and lawfully when handling public funds, and follow the relevant policies and procedures of both the School and the Council. Employees must not accept or offer any bribes or inducements for doing or not doing anything in their official capacity, as this is a criminal offence. Employees should also avoid any situations that could create a suspicion of corruption, such as negotiating contracts alone or without proper records. This paragraph outlines the standards of behaviour for managing public funds and avoiding fraud and corruption.\n\nThe School also expects its employees to declare any personal interests that could potentially conflict with their work duties, such as financial interests or memberships of organisations.

This permission may be given for some services that can be used privately on payment of a fee, such as telephone calls or photocopying.

      "Left": "Upon Austria 's entrance into the war in summer 1805 , Klenau joined the Habsburg army in southern Germany and became mired in a short campaign that exposed the worst of the Habsburg military organization . Archduke Charles was sick , and had retired to recuperate . Archduke Ferdinand , the brother-in-law of the Emperor Francis , was theoretically in command , but Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement , having neither experience , maturity , nor aptitude . Although Ferdinand retained nominal command , decisions were placed in the hands of Karl Mack , who was timid , indecisive , and ill-suited for such an important assignment . Furthermore , Mack had been wounded earlier in the campaign , and was unable to take full charge of the army . Consequently , command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp , Prince of Schwarzenberg , an able military officer , but as yet inexperienced in the command of such a large army .\n The campaign began in October , with several clashes in Swabia . At the first , near the Bavarian town of Wertingen , 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) northwest of Augsburg , on 8 October , Murat 's Cavalry Corps and grenadiers of Lannes ' V Corps surprised an Austrian force half their size . The Austrians had assembled in line , and the cavalry and grenadiers cut them down before the Austrians could form their defensive squares . Nearly 3,000 were captured . A day later , at Günzburg immediately south of the Danube , the French again met an Austrian force ; General Mack could not decide on a plan , and the French 59th Regiment of the Line stormed a bridge over the Danube , and , in a humiliating episode , chased two large Austrian columns toward Ulm . In this action , the French secured an important bridgehead on the Danube River .",
      "Right": "Despite Klenau 's success at the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen , the Austrians could not sustain their positions around him , and the entire line retreated toward Ulm . Napoleon 's lightning campaign exposed the Austrian weaknesses , particularly of indecisive command structure and poor supply apparatus . The Austrians were low on ammunition and outgunned . The components of the army , division by division , were being separated from one another . Morale sank , \" sapped by Mack 's chaotic orders and their [ the troops ] growing lack of confidence in their nominal commander , \" Ferdinand . Following the Austrian capitulation at Memmingen , 55 kilometers ( 34 mi ) south of Ulm , the French achieved a morale boost over the Austrians at the Battle of Elchingen , outside of Biberach , on 14 October . Here , 12 kilometers ( 7 mi ) northeast of Ulm , and slightly north of the Danube , Ney 's VI Corps ( 20,000 men ) captured half of the Austrian Reserve Artillery park at <unk> . In a further blow , Field Marshal Riesch was unable to destroy the Danube bridges , which Ney secured for the French . Ney received the victory title , Duke of Elchingen .\n At this point , the entire Austrian force , including Klenau 's column , withdrew into Ulm and its environs and Napoleon himself arrived to take command of the II , V , VI Corps , Ney 's Cavalry and the Imperial Guard , numbering close to 80,000 men . Archduke Ferdinand and a dozen cavalry squadrons broke out through the French army and escaped into Bohemia . Again , as he had been at Mantua , Klenau was caught in a siege from which there was no escape , and again , he helped to negotiate the terms , when , on 21 October , Karl Mack surrendered the encircled army of 20,000 infantry and 3,273 cavalry . Klenau and the other officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until exchanged , an agreement to which they held .",
      "Passage": "With the string of French victories , Lieutenant Field Marshal Klenau provided the only ray of hope in a campaign fraught with losses . At Ulm-Jungingen , Klenau had arranged his 25,000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and , on 11 October , an over-confident General of Division <unk> de l 'Étang attacked Klenau 's force with fewer than 8,000 men . The French lost 1,500 dead and wounded , 900 captured , 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons captured , but possibly of greater significance , the Imperial Eagles and <unk> of the 15th and 17th Dragoons were taken by the Austrians ."

The Austrians also took the Imperial Eagles and <unk> of the 15th and 17th Dragoons , a significant blow to French morale .",
      "Outcome2": "One of the few bright spots for the Austrians was Klenau, who fought well against a stronger French force. He killed or wounded many of them, captured some of their soldiers and weapons, and even took their flags. But this was not enough to stop the French from winning everywhere else.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the few Austrian successes in the campaign was Klenau 's victory over a smaller French force at Ulm-Jungingen on 11 October , where he captured two Imperial Eagles and inflicted heavy casualties . However , this did not stop the French advance and the encirclement of the main Austrian army at Ulm . After several other battles , General Mack surrendered with 23,000 men on 21 October , while Archduke Ferdinand and some cavalry escaped . Klenau and his fellow officers were released on parole .",
      "Outcome4": "On 11 October , Klenau won the only Austrian victory at Ulm-Jungingen , where he outnumbered and defeated General <unk> 's 8,000 Frenchmen , killing or capturing 2,400 and seizing two Imperial Eagles .",
      "Outcome5": "Some of the French soldiers were very good at fighting, and they beat the Austrians many times. One Austrian leader, Klenau, was very brave and smart, and he made his soldiers fight well against the French. But the other Austrian leaders were not good at their jobs, and they did not know what to do. The French soldiers chased them all the way to a big city called Ulm, where they were surrounded by many more French soldiers. The Austrians had no more bullets or food, and they felt very sad and scared. Klenau helped to talk to the French leader, Napoleon, who said he would let them go if they promised not to fight him again for a while.",
      "Outcome6": "Despite the series of French victories that had shattered the Austrian army , Lieutenant Field Marshal Klenau managed to achieve a notable success at the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen , where he commanded a large Austrian force in a strong defensive position . On 11 October , he faced an attack by General of Division <unk> de l 'Étang , who rashly led a much smaller French force against Klenau 's well-prepared lines . The battle resulted in a heavy defeat for the French , who suffered 1,500 casualties and 900 prisoners , as well as losing 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons . Moreover , the Austrians captured two Imperial Eagles and <unk> from the 15th and 17th Dragoons , which were symbols of French honor and prestige .",

Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.",

However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.",

One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project.

      "Outcome3": "Another essential quality of a good roommate is communication. People have diverse preferences and routines in their daily life, such as making the bed in the morning.

Therefore, communication is vital as it can prevent misunderstandings and conflicts. Through communication, trust and friendship are fostered and we can learn more about each other.",
      "Outcome4": "Communication also matters for a good roommate. People have different habits, such as making the bed. What seems easy for one may be hard for another. Moving out over a trivial issue like this is not worth it. Therefore, communication can prevent misunderstandings and help roommates get along better.",
      "Outcome5": "Another thing that makes a good roommate is talking to each other. People like different things and do things in different ways. For example, some people like to make their bed every morning, and some people don't. If you get angry at your roommate for not making their bed, you might want to leave. But that is not a good reason to lose a friend. So you should talk to your roommate and tell them how you feel and listen to how they feel. Talking can help you understand each other better and be nicer to each other.",
      "Outcome6": "Another essential aspect of being a good roommate is communication. People have different habits and preferences in their daily lives, such as whether to tidy the blanket in the morning or not. One person might think this is a simple and courteous thing to do, while another might consider it a waste of time and energy. If one person decides to move out just because his roommate does not tidy up the blanket in the morning, he might be missing out on a chance to resolve the issue peacefully. Therefore, communication is very important as it would help to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts. Through communication, roommates can also build trust and rapport and have a better understanding of each other's needs and expectations.",

In contrast , many of the surviving acts moved on to different musical styles that were either more rooted in traditional forms or more adventurous in experimentation .

Some people still liked their music and made it sound more like fairy tales.",
      "Outcome6": "As the 1960s came to a close , the psychedelic music scene faced a number of challenges and changes that led to its decline . One of the factors was the legal status of LSD , which was banned in both the US and UK in 1966 , making it harder for musicians and fans to access and use the drug that had inspired much of the psychedelic sound and culture . Another factor was the public perception of psychedelia , which was tarnished by the association of some Beatles songs with the horrific crimes committed by The Manson Family cult in 1969 . These songs, such as \" Helter Skelter \" , were interpreted by cult leader Charles Manson as messages of an impending apocalyptic race war . The same year , a free concert at Altamont Speedway in California , which featured The Rolling Stones as the main act , turned violent when a member of the Hells Angels motorcycle club , who were hired as security guards , stabbed and killed a young black man named Meredith Hunter in front of the stage . The event was seen as a dark contrast to the peaceful and idealistic Woodstock festival that had taken place earlier that year .\n\nThe psychedelic music scene also suffered from internal problems , such as mental breakdowns , drug overdoses , creative disputes and band breakups . Some of the most prominent figures of psychedelia became victims of what were called \" acid casualties \" , meaning they were unable to cope with reality after excessive use of LSD or other drugs . These included Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys , who retreated from public life and suffered from depression and schizophrenia ; Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones, who was fired from the band due to his drug addiction and erratic behavior, and later drowned in his swimming pool ; Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac, who developed schizophrenia and left the band ; and Syd Barrett of Pink Floyd, who also suffered from schizophrenia and withdrew from music altogether . These losses affected not only their personal lives but also their musical direction, as they had been influential leaders or founders of their respective bands. Other bands that had been at the forefront of psychedelic rock, such as The Jimi Hendrix Experience and Cream, disbanded due to artistic differences or personal conflicts. Some of the most iconic stars of psychedelia also died prematurely, often due to drug-related causes. Jimi Hendrix died in London in September 1970 after choking on his own vomit following a barbiturate overdose ; Janis Joplin died in October 1970 from a heroin overdose ; Jim Morrison died in Paris in July 1971 from heart failure, possibly caused by heroin .\n\nAs a result of these factors, many surviving acts moved away from psychedelia into different musical genres or styles. Some returned to a more stripped-down and raw approach to rock music, often referred to as \" roots rock \" or \" hard rock \" . This was evident in albums such as Beggar 's Banquet ( 1968 ) and Exile on Main St. ( 1972 ) by The Rolling Stones ; The Beatles ( 1968 ) and Let It Be ( 1970 ) by The Beatles ; Band Of Gypsies ( 1970 ) by Jimi Hendrix ; Led Zeppelin II ( 1969 ) by Led Zeppelin ; Who's Next ( 1971 ) by The Who ; Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs ( 1970 ) by Derek And The Dominos . Some explored more complex and diverse forms of music, often incorporating elements from classical , jazz or world music. This gave rise to progressive rock, which was characterized by long compositions",

My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.",
      "Right": "Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.",

The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by.

      "Left": "The first one is the 1-D BTI Analysis Tool (BAT), which can predict the time evolution of measured degradation during and after DC stress at different bias and temperature, during AC stress at different bias, temperature, frequency and duty cycle, and during multiple and arbitrary mixed DC-AC stress sequences under dynamic voltage, frequency and activity scaling. The simulator can predict measured data across device dimensions, explain the impact of HKMG process changes, and is compatible with both Si and SiGe channels. Next, implementation of the correct physical model in a commercial TCAD tool will be discussed. This enables accurate 3-D simulation of degradation in different device architectures and geometries, such as deeply scaled FinFETs and GAA NWFETs, where quantum confinement plays an important role. The impact of architecture, dimension and channel material on device lifetime will be accessed. Finally, we will discuss the development of a kinetic Monte Carlo process based stochastic simulator, which is based on the identified physical mechanism. We will demonstrate the consistency of the identified physical mechanism between large area deterministic and small area stochastic processes, and establish the equivalence of both these modeling frameworks.\n By early 2000s, many researchers would begin their talks with an iconic cartoon that superimposed the images of rocket nozzles and the sun, increasing power dissipation of an IC to the images of rocket nozzles and picture of the Sun. The message was difficult to ignore: the voltage-scaling kept power-dissipation at bay. Fast forward to 2015 - the tyranny of short channel effects at the sub 32 nm nodes has led to the development of FIGFET and ETSOI technologies, with gate-all-around III-V transistors in the horizon. The short channel effects are controlled, but at the expense of additional self-heating of the system. Stacks of materials (many poor thermal conductors) now surround the very hot channel to make the bad situation worse. In this tutorial, I will discuss the mapping the self-heating in 3D in surround gate transistors and how self-heating redefines and conflates the traditional notions of performance and reliability of ultrathin transistors and frontend and backend issues of modern ICs. The goal would be to connect the system to device perspectives to provide an end-to-end holistic view of the performance of self-heated integrated circuits.",

Today , the breed comes in a wide variety of colors , including dun , bay , roan , chestnut , black and grullo . Historically , multi-colored patterns such as pinto were found , but they were not selected for when breeding , and today are not seen . The colors today are consistent with those of other Colonial Spanish horses . The profile of the breed 's head is usually flat or somewhat concave , becoming slightly convex from the nasal region to the top of the muzzle . The forehead is wide and the eyes set well apart . The breed typically has a slight ewe neck , and the neck is attached low on the chest compared to many other breeds . The withers are pronounced , the back short and strong , and the croup steeply angled . The chest is deep but narrow and the shoulder long and angled . The legs have long , tapering muscling , with in general no feathering on the lower legs . The Marsh Tacky exhibits a four-beat ambling gait , most similar to the <unk> <unk> of the Brazilian Mangalarga Marchador , another breed with Spanish heritage , although also compared to the fox trot of the Missouri Fox Trotter . However , the Marsh Tacky 's gait shows a period of quadrupedal support where all four feet are planted and diagonal foot pairings , whereas the Fox Trotter shows tripedal support and the Mangalarga Marchador lacks the diagonal foot pairings .",

      "Left": "Email and texting are powerful communication tools, and essential to the workings of the Benefice. They can be used to complement other forms of communication. They are not a replacement for face to face communication for sensitive matters or imparting information likely to upset. \n This Policy applies to anyone using electronic communication and social media platforms for church business within the Benefice. \n Copies of the Policy will be given to new office holders when taking on roles within the Benefice and to all individuals who agree to be included on group email address lists. Chairs of committees or groups are responsible for ensuring that their committee or group members see and understand the Policy. \n We will use email for secretarial business eg circulating rotas; minutes of meetings; notices; documents or thoughts to be discussed at the next meeting. Email can be used for event organisation which needs attention before the next meeting. Email or Microsoft Office 365 SharePoint can be used for conducting simple business but is not suitable for business that requires discussion or results in disagreement. \n Where differences of opinion result through e-conversation, electronic communication should cease, and conversation continue by telephone, face to face or in the next meeting. Allow time to reflect wisely and slowly before responding to emails. Be mindful that emails can be misread or misinterpreted. Take time and care when writing and when reading. Emails can be written and saved as drafts to be reread at a later time before sending. \n Forwarding emails\nEmails are for the recipient(s) only. If it is necessary to do so, forward an email to somebody else, but only if the content of the email is purely business and not confidential or controversial. If in any doubt, consider responding with 'The most appropriate person to deal with this is x. Would you like me to forward your email or would you like to approach directly?' \n Be particularly mindful when forwarding emails from people who are personal friends as well as church partners to avoid confusion over private correspondence and church business.",
      "Right": "Closed group emails\nWhen emailing closed groups eg PCC, DCC or committees, the email addresses of all recipients should be available for all to see. This is to ensure that nobody has been inadvertently left off the list and to allow individuals to reply to the whole group. Give consideration to the timing and content of emails, which can often be received out of working hours on mobile phones or tablets. Avoid using'reply to all' unless it is absolutely necessary. \n Access to email addresses\nEmail addresses obtained by being a member of a closed group should only be used for the purposes of communicating with the group on group business. The email address should not be used for other purposes or passed to anyone else. If your email address is used by more than one person this must be made clear to anyone sending emails. Electronic devices storing other people's personal data should be protected by passwords and a fire wall. Office holders and other people conducting confidential business on behalf of the benefice must have their own email address which only they have access to. Be mindful of information written in emails. \n Members of the Church acting in an official capacity can request permission from the Data Controllers to become a contributor. Anyone approved by the Data Controllers to post on social media on behalf of the Benefice will sign to say they have read the Safeguarding Policy and agree to comply. Contributors do not need authorisation to post 'factual' non-controversial entries about Church events, such as date, time and venue, or positive feedback to or from others. However, contributors using the Benefice Twitter or Facebook accounts must not post or retweet non-factual'subjective' posts, or post photos naming individuals, without their consent. Before retweeting, it is important to check the original source of the tweet for appropriate content. If a contributor is unsure whether a post is appropriate they must seek approval from the Parish Data Controllers. This Policy does not preclude Staff or any other members of the Church from posting'subjective' material via their own personal Social Media accounts. \n Before posting photographs on Social Media, refer to the Diocese of Oxford Making and Publishing images of Children. \n This policy is to be read in conjunction with General Data Protection Regulations and the Benefice Safeguarding Policy. \n Adopted by Minster Lovell PCC on 27 November 2019\nReview date: 3 years from date of adoption",

      "Left": "The black intellectual I got no respect for. The white intellectual I got no use for. Don't bother me. We're in the same cotton field.\n Our tendency takes the position that in the process of the struggles of different sections of the class for more power, the power of the class as a whole develops. While the autonomous struggles and perspectives of the less powerful sections (all of them, not women alone) are an ongoing reference point for white male workers, we maintain.that the struggles of the more powerful have been, and can continue to be. a source of increased power for the less powerful sections. In most circumstances, our struggles and the struggles of other groups on the more powerful side of power relations within the class (e.g. parent/child; teachers/students) are a source of power for the less powerful indirectly just as we gain increased from the struggles of the less powerful indirectly, in that the direct objective of most struggles is more power for the group that's struggling. For example, the wages and power we win becomes the target for less powerful sections. In other circumstances, as the working class struggle develops, more direct forms of circulation of power are possible and necessary, but in all situations, workers in whatever section of the class they belong to, will move only when they see it increasing their power fairly directly and concretely. Workers are seldom liberals.\n There are several examples we could use to be more concrete. The Quebec teachers' current struggles for wage parity with Ontario teachers and for decreased workloads is a case in point. After a prolonged period this winter and spring of work-to-rule campaigns and walkouts, the Quebec government passed a law prohibiting all forms of work stoppages and slowdowns, as well as prohibiting parents from withholding children from schools, which had developed to support the teachers. When the law passed, thousands of parents continued withholding their kids from school, and hundreds set up picket lines with students at schools to prevent the resumption of school. The point is that teachers were able to use their power and convince less powerful groups that they were so using their power, to struggle against the state's plan for students. The concrete mass support they received from parents and students indicates that they too saw the struggle as a source of power for them.",
      "Right": "So for us it is essential to become fully part of the struggles of our own section of the class, and interact with other sections from that position, constantly posing the question at every stage of how our struggles can build the power of the whole class, as well as how the struggles of the less powerful sections build our power and that of the whole class.\n No one section of the class can express the experience or substitute itself for the struggle for more power of other section. Each section has strengths particular to it which are indispensable to overcoming the weaknesses particular to other sections; no one section has all the strengths sufficient to build the power of the whole class. One of the important aspects of leadership within each section of the class is to be aware of your own section's strengths and weaknesses, in relation to the strengths and weaknesses of other sections and be able to relate that concretely to developing more power for the whole class. At different stages of the working class struggle, the strengths particular to different sections of the class are central to advancing the class as a whole; no one section is \"the\" leading section once and for all time.\n To locate our own struggles as white male workers within this perspective on relations of power within the class is the basis for developing a strategic and organizational perspective which can contribute to the development of the power of the whole class.",
      "Passage": "Closer to home, we think it's important for us to see how our struggle as young white refusers in the last ten years has been a source of power to women generally, and certainly to the specific women we have related to. It's no accident that the women's movement has been primarily a white women's movement. Part of that has to do with the fact that we have made struggles against capital's command of our lives that have won us the time and money and power which has made it less necessary to make the demands on women which our fathers did or which black men or immigrant men do. This is not to say our struggle was more important than women's struggle in this arena, but simply to assert that our struggle is a source of power for women. It's important to develop this if we are to avoid the politics of guilt in our relations with other sections of the class."

      "Outcome1": "More concretely, we need to understand how our struggle as young white refusers in the past decade has empowered women in general, and especially the women we have been close to. It is not a coincidence that the women's movement has mainly involved white women. This partly reflects the fact that we have fought against capital's control over our lives and gained some time, money and power that have reduced our dependence on and domination over women, unlike our fathers or many black men or immigrant men. This does not mean our struggle was more important than women's struggle in this area, but simply that our struggle has been a source of power for women. We need to recognize this if we want to avoid the politics of guilt in our relations with other sections of the class. By the politics of guilt, we mean the tendency to feel guilty or ashamed of our relative privilege or power within the class, and to either deny it, apologize for it, or try to compensate for it by being paternalistic or deferential to less powerful groups. This is not a constructive way of relating to other sections of the class, because it does not challenge the power relations that produce inequality and oppression. It also does not acknowledge the potential contribution of our own struggles to building the power of the whole class.",
      "Outcome2": "Our group is young white men who don't follow the rules. We think our fight helps women too, not just ourselves. Most women who fight for their rights are white like us. That's partly because we have more freedom and money than other men, so we don't need women to do everything for us. We are not saying we are better than women or other men, but we want to show how our fight is good for them. We don't want to feel guilty or sorry for them.",
      "Outcome3": "It is important for white male workers to see how their struggle as young refusers in the last decade has been a source of power to women in general, and especially to the women they have interacted with. The predominance of white women in the women's movement is partly related to the fact that white male workers have challenged capital's control over their lives and gained more time, money and power, which has reduced their need to impose demands on women that their fathers or men of other races and ethnicities did. This does not mean that their struggle was more significant than the struggle of women in this area, but simply that their struggle is a source of power for women. Recognizing this can help avoid a guilt-ridden politics in relations with other sections of the class.",
      "Outcome4": "As young white refusers, we have increased women's power by resisting capital's control over us. This shows that our struggle and the struggles of other more powerful groups can benefit the less powerful sections of the class, as well as ourselves. But we also need to learn from and support the autonomous struggles of the less powerful, like women, blacks, immigrants, students and so on. We are not liberals who sacrifice our own interests for others; we are part of a class that can only grow stronger by fighting together against the state and capital.",
      "Outcome5": "Let's say you and your friends are playing in a big yard. Some of you have more toys than others, and some of you are stronger or faster than others. Sometimes, you want to play with more toys, or have more space, or make the rules of the game. This is like a struggle for more power. When you struggle for more power, you can also help your friends who have less power. For example, if you share your toys with them, or stand up for them when someone is mean to them, or listen to their ideas. This way, all of you can have more fun and be happier. But sometimes, your friends who have less power also want to struggle for more power by themselves. They might want to play with different toys, or play a different game, or have their own space. This is also good for you and all your friends, because it makes everyone feel more free and confident. So when you and your friends struggle for more power in different ways, you should always try to help each other and learn from each other. This way, all of you can become stronger and smarter together.",
      "Outcome6": "One example that is relevant for us is how our refusal as young white workers to accept the discipline and drudgery of capital in the last decade has increased the power of women in general, and especially of the women we have been close to. It is not a coincidence that the women's movement has been mainly composed of white women. This is partly because our refusal has created more space and resources for us to challenge the traditional roles and expectations that men had imposed on women, as our fathers did or as black men or immigrant men still do. We are not claiming that our refusal was more important than the struggle of women themselves in this area, but simply that our refusal was a source of power for women. We need to recognize this if we want to avoid feeling guilty or defensive in our relations with other sections of the class.",

      "Left": "Lights flashed. Actors and actresses sang on stage and jumped rope simultaneously. Other participants bantered back and forth in aisles and seats of front rows in the spacious auditorium, awaiting their turn to perform. Directives of instruction were called out as snippets of an entire scene gradually coalesced into one.\n Nor was this a London opera house. The scenario was the Pequannock Township High School auditorium in Pompton Plains. Over 30 students of the PTHS drama team convened on Saturday morning, February 2, to prepare for their upcoming performance of the musical, \"Legally Blonde.\" On the far side of the auditorium with professional lighting equipment in place, each artisan came forward for a promotional photo.\n Bolstered by a degree in Theater Tech & Design from Slippery Rock University, Ms. LaShure has been directing plays for 26 years. She oversaw the production of Godspell last year at PTHS. \"The students have really embraced this and are working hard to put on a show they are really proud of,\" Ms. LaShure said. \"Musically, this is a very challenging show. In addition to our weekly scheduled rehearsals, the students have also worked one on one with Judy Sayad, the PTHS Choir & Musical Director, both individually and in groups. They desire to perfect harmonies and make sure they know their music inside and out. They have focused very strongly on learning their lines and being 'off book', meaning having their lines learned much earlier than usual. The six students who are performing the choreography in the number 'Whipped into Shape', began working with our amazing choreographer, Amy Hadam, back in December. The number requires doing intricate jump rope choreography and singing at the same time. \"\nThe director said that preparation for dress rehearsal and live presentation has been a team effort. \"The cast and crew students assisted with the set build,\" Ms. LaShure continued. \"Cast members have also overseen the costume plot/design for this show and will be handling makeup and hair design. Most impressively, the core group of cast members, composed of junior and seniors, have had many bonding experiences. New students, from freshmen to seniors, have become part of the theater group this year. It is really nice to see a group of students get along so well, really like each other, and look out for each other.\"",
      "Right": "Donning the blonde wig that she will wear at curtain call, Elizabeth Finnen described the play's plot which will include plenty of humor, yet also convey a valuable lesson. Elizabeth plays the lead female role, Elle Woods. \"Legally Blonde is about a girl who lives in California,\" the 18-year old senior stated. \"She's a Malibu girl. She's wealthy and is seen as blonde and dumb. Her boyfriend breaks up with her and goes away to college at Harvard. She then follows him to college to show how smart and important she actually is. This play is really about believing in oneself and not worrying about what other people think. \"\nPerhaps granting a nod over any professional New York City performance by their presence, were two very special play participants. Ferris will play the role of Bruiser. Moka will take on the part of Rufus. The former's impressive resume includes previously starring in the same role at the Community Theatre in Belvidere. The latter plans to perfectly compliment her counterpart. With the above being said, the two aspiring stars are actually of canine stock. Ferris is a male, 11-year old chihuahua owned by Michelle Bochenk. Moka is female Shih Tzu-Russel Terrier mix. \"Ferris likes his costumes and likes to be in his bag\", Ms. Bochenek said. \"He is capable of several wardrobe changes including wearing a pink Izod shirt. \"\nSenior Madison Levine will take responsibility of the management of Rufus while on stage. She expressed no trepidation about doing so. \"I feel pretty good about holding Rufus,\" Madison said. \"I will also have Rufus on a leash. I am used to dogs. I have my own Maltese Poodle who is much yappier.\" Madison has been acting for 10 years played roles in the last three high school plays. She attends the Performing Arts School in Boonton and plans on majoring in playwriting in college.\n Dance Captain Jessica Rhinesmith was back at practice after having volunteered for the PTHS stop hunger outreach, Empty Bowls Dinner, held previously in the week. \"This is my 4th year that I have been involved in dancing and choreography for our school plays,\" the 17-year old senior said. \"This is my first year as dance captain.\" Jessica said she helps classmates new to drama learn the different dance steps.",

      "Left": "With respect to depositions, the Court will not intervene in an ongoing deposition via telephone to resolve disputes; rather, counsel shall resolve such disputes in the same manner described above for discovery disputes. Counsel are expected to adhere strictly to Colo. R. Civ. 30(d)(1) and (3) and shall refrain from \"speaking objections,\" excessive objections designed to disrupt the flow of questioning, advising a witness to answer \"if you know\" or \"if you remember\" or \"not to speculate,\" asking for clarification of a question, or conferring with a witness while questions are pending or documents are being reviewed unless authorized under Colo. R. Civ.\n At any time during the pendency of the case, any party may request additional case management conferences including brief telephonic conferences if needed.\n The Court orders discovery to commence immediately from the date of the \"At Issue\" order.\n Please note the 2015 Comment to Colo. R. Civ. To the extent that Colo. R. Civ. 12 was not followed in this case, any affirmative defenses must be re-pled with a factual basis.\n If the parties settle the case after trial has been set, the Court will not vacate the trial until the parties have filed a stipulation to dismiss the case with prejudice. Parties must seek a Court order to modify any deadline or order. A stipulation is not binding on the Court.\n16.1, and those portions of Colo. R. Civ. 16 made applicable by Colo. R. Civ. 16.1, govern this case except as modified herein. The Court expects full compliance with its \"At Issue\" Order and any other orders subsequently entered in this case. Failure to fully and timely comply with such orders, or to adequately explain said failure in writing by the date required for compliance, may result in the issuance of a show cause order without further notice. The order will require the personal appearances of attorneys of record and pro se parties at the show cause hearing.\n Once all parties have been served and either have appeared or defaulted, the Court will declare this case to be at issue pursuant to Colo. R. Civ. 16(b)(1) and 16.1(f).\n Counsel and any parties who are pro se shall confer as required by Colo. R. Civ. If that conference has not already occurred it shall be completed no later than 14 days from the date of the \"At Issue\" Order.",

The Court expects the certificate to be complete and accurate setting forth specific calendar date deadlines so that the Court can determine the status of the case. This includes 16.1 (k)(2) and (3) deadlines.\n The Court is very willing to conduct a case management conference as contemplated by Colo. R. Civ. 16.1(j) either by personal appearance or by telephone. Initial Case Management Conferences will generally be set for a Tuesday or Thursday at 9:00 a.m. The parties are directed to contact the Court's Division Clerk, Jessica Wichman, at (970) 494-3610 if they wish to set a case management conference. If counsel and/or parties anticipate that the case management conference will require more than 15 minutes, please inform the clerk so that it may be set appropriately.\n Further, please include information regarding any parties in interest who have limited English proficiency so that advanced arrangements for interpretation can be made for court proceedings. Please include the party's primary spoken language, including the origin of the language (i.e., region of the world) in order to better identify the dialect of language.\n The Court permits limited discovery under Colo. R. Civ. 16.1(k), to the extent allowed by Colo. R. Civ. Because discovery is limited, it is particularly important that parties honor the requirements and spirit of full disclosure. Procedures for discovery disputes are the same as specified above for Colo. R. Civ.\n Motions in limine are discouraged if the Court needs to hear evidence at trial to resolve them. If a party files a motion in limine, it is due no later than 35 days before the trial. Rule 702 Motions must be filed no later than 70 days before the trial.\n Procedures for Motions to dismiss pursuant to Colo. R. Civ.\n Motions to dismiss under Colo. R. Civ. 12(b) are discouraged if the defect may be resolved by the filing of an amended pleading.",

Accordingly, do not notice the case in for trial setting within 42 days from the at issue date. Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Court will set the case for trial only after completion of non-expert discovery and alternative dispute resolution (\"ADR\").

Civ. 16.1(g). The rationale for this deviation from the rule is to improve the availability of trial dates for those cases that are more likely to need a trial and to use the limited judicial resources more efficiently. Therefore, parties should not request a trial setting within 42 days from the at issue date, unless there are extraordinary circumstances that justify an expedited trial. The Court will normally set the case for trial only after non-expert discovery and alternative dispute resolution (\"ADR\") have been completed or attempted. In order to assist the Court in scheduling trials, the parties should provide realistic and accurate estimates of when they expect the case to be ready for trial in their certificate of compliance or stipulated modified case management order.

      "Left": "9.5.3.2 Group addressed message\nA group addressed message is sent to instruct the recipients to take an action. The MIHF Group ID of the target group is set to the Desitnation MIHF ID field in the group addressed message. A group addressed message is sent using a multicast transport associated with the MIHF Group ID. A group addressed message may alternatively take two types of payload: protected and non-protected.\n 9.5.3.2.1 Protected payload\nA protected payload is encrypted using the SA derived from the MGK. The SA is identified by the SA ID. The SA ID is carried in the MIH header of the group addressed message. The SA ID is a 32-bit value that is composed of a 16-bit SA ID Type and a 16-bit SA ID Value. The SA ID Type indicates the type of the SA ID Value. The SA ID Value is a value that is used to identify the SA. The SA ID Value can be either a Node Index or a GKB ID. The Node Index is a k-bit string that identifies a node in the key tree. The GKB ID is a 16-bit value that identifies a GKB. The SA ID Type and the SA ID Value are defined in Table 18.\n 9.5.3.2.2 Non-protected payload\nA non-protected payload is not encrypted. A non-protected payload may be used when the group addressed message does not contain any sensitive information or when the group addressed message is already protected by another security mechanism. A non-protected payload may also be used when the group addressed message is sent to a recipient that is not in the group but is expected to join the group. A non-protected payload may also be used when the group addressed message is sent to a recipient that is in the group but is expected to leave the group. A non-protected payload may also be used when the group addressed message is sent to a recipient that is not in the group and is not expected to join the group. A non-protected payload may also be used when the group addressed message is sent to a recipient that is in the group and is not expected to leave the group.\n The following is a possible way to separate the document into new paragraphs based on semantic similarity.

      "Right": "'\nIssue 1: It is better to rename CC (Command Center) to GM (Group Manager) since a group addressed command/message may be sent by a PoS that does not have a group manipulation functionality such as issuing a group manipulation command.\n Issue 2: It is better to remove the terms GMCS and GMCR since (1) the roles of GMCS and GMCR can change per message basis and (2) the terms are used in 9.5.3.1 and 9.5.3.2 only. It is better to describe those sections without introducing new terms.\n Issue 3: It is better to replace the term \"group addressed command\" with \"group addressed message\" since there are a number of MIH messages that can be multicast but do not belong to command service.\n Issues 1 and 2 are relatively easier to resolve than Issue 3.\n'\n With regard to Issue 3, it has been identified that there is one exceptional case where a MIH_Capability_Discover request message sent to MIHF Broadcast ID can be sent by an MN, while all other group addressed messages are sent by a PoS. Since there may be other MN-originated group addressed messages defined in a future, it is suggested to revise Section 9 such that not only PoS-originated group addressed messages but also MN-originated group addressed messages are also covered. From security point of view, digital signature usage for group addressed message may need to be reconsidered. There are three options:\nOption 1: Make digital signature mandatory for all group addressed messages\nOption 2: Make digital signature mandatory for PoS-originated group addressed messages and optional for MN-originated group addressed messages\nOption 3: Make digital signature optional for all group addressed messages\n'\n The following remedies are proposed in addition to those described in DCN 097.\n Section 3\ngroup manager (GM): An MIH User that manages the group by adding, deleting, and updating the group membership information. It may also generate the group key when needed. It is also the entity that issues group manipulation commands.\n group addressed message: An MIH message sent to nodes that belong to a group identified by an MIHF Group ID.

      "Right": "The Los Angeles area has been especially dry. Dr. Swain said that Los Angeles has had only one 24-hour period with rainfall of more than one-third of an inch in nearly a year.\n But overall, the current conditions are far less extreme than in 2015 and 2016, at the tail end of the drought. At times in 2015 more than half the state was considered to be in extreme drought, the drought monitor's highest category. That spring, the state imposed a mandatory 25 percent reduction in water use in urban areas.\n State water officials note that this year, as a result of the drought-ending rains of a year ago, there is plenty of water in California's reservoirs, so there are no critical supply issues that could lead to similar restrictions.\n Without a flurry of storms to add to the snowpack in the next few months, the low snowpack could eventually lead to supply problems, especially if dry conditions persist for the next few years.\n It's very normal to have a ridge,\" said Dr. Ralph, who studies so-called atmospheric rivers, trails of tropical moisture that in a normal year are responsible for much of California's precipitation. \" It usually breaks down at some point and packs of storms break through. \"\nA few studies have suggested that the persistence of such blocking ridges in certain parts of the world may be linked to climate change.\n The thin California snowpack is also a function of high temperatures.\n They also cause what snow there is to melt faster.\n Rain runs off immediately, while snowpack serves as a reservoir of water that is released over time as it melts. So, changes in the proportions of snow and rain and the rate of snowmelt can affect the availability and timing of water for people, industry and agriculture.\n The blocking pattern in the atmosphere has also brought warm, dry conditions to the Rocky Mountains and the Colorado River basin, said Greg Smith, a senior hydrologist with the National Weather Service in Salt Lake City.\n Most of the storms track to the north of the region, he said, \"and the storms that do come in tend to be weak. \"\n But without significant snowfall by April, even the upper basin will suffer.\n There's definitely some concern for supplies in some areas as we see these forecast numbers drop,\" Mr. Smith said. \" We're kind of hopeful we'll see a pattern change in the next couple of months. We're running out of time.\"",

But sometimes, the rain gets blocked by a big wall of air over the ocean. Then it can't reach California and we have very dry and warm days for a long time. This is called a drought, and it can make it hard for us to have enough water for drinking, washing and farming. When it snows in the mountains, it also gives us water when it melts slowly. But if it's too warm, the snow melts too fast or turns into rain. Then we can't save the water for later when we need it. The big wall of air sometimes goes away and lets the rain come through again, but we don't know when that will happen. Some people think that the weather is changing because of things that humans do, and that makes the big wall of air stay longer and come more often.",
      "Outcome6": "As California faces another dry winter, the specter of a prolonged drought looms over the state. The atmospheric conditions that contributed to the previous multiyear drought, which ended in 2017, have reappeared and prevented many storms from reaching the state or weakened their impact. The lack of sufficient precipitation has left the state parched and unusually warm this winter, raising concerns among residents and officials about the possibility of another long period of water scarcity.\nOne indicator of drought severity, the U.S. Drought Monitor, shows that most of the state is already experiencing some level of drought or abnormal dryness.",

      "Left": "Hurricane Carol produced hurricane and gale force winds across New England . Strong winds from Hurricane Carol destroyed nearly 40 % of the apple , corn , peach , and tomato crops from eastern Connecticut to Cape Cod . Overall crop damage was estimated at $ 22.25 million . The hurricane destroyed several thousand homes in New England , many of which were destroyed from the waters or the powerful winds . Overall , 11,785 families were directly impacted by the hurricane , including 9,720 houses that were damaged and 1,545 that were destroyed . High winds left over 150,000 people without power in New England , potentially as many as one-third of all of New England , and many residents also lost phone service . The hurricane also destroyed 3,500 cars and 3,000 boats in the region . Heavy rainfall from the storm caused traffic accidents , but only minor flooding .\n Throughout the United States , Hurricane Carol caused $ 461 million in damage , mostly in New England , making it the costliest Atlantic hurricane at the time . There were 65 deaths in New England , and about 1,000 injured people . Despite the high damage , advance warning allowed for many fewer deaths than the total of 488 fatalities during the 1938 New England hurricane , which affected the same area with similar strength . However , some areas did not receive advance warning , due to power outages preventing people from receiving Weather Bureau warnings ahead of the storm .\n Hurricane Carol struck Connecticut shortly after high tide , and its combination with 10 to 15 feet ( 3 to 4.5 m ) storm surges from New London eastward produced widespread tidal flooding . About 2,000 people were stranded when a rail line between New Haven and Rhode Island was flooded . The heaviest rainfall associated with the passage of the storm occurred in New London , where up to 6 inches ( 150 mm ) fell and wind blew off a portion of the city hall roof . These strong winds left much of the eastern portion of the state without power . Near the coast , the combination of strong winds and the storm surge damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings , including 100 destroyed houses . Many other homes in Eastern Connecticut were damaged by falling trees . Thousands had evacuated before the storm reached the area , and one person died in the state . Due to the compact nature of the storm , western Connecticut experienced little effects from Carol . Overall damage in the state was estimated at $ 50 million .",
      "Right": "Before Carol affected the area , 20,000 people evacuated from Cape Cod . In Massachusetts , the hurricane produced winds between 80 and 110 mph ( 130 to 180 km / h ) across much of the eastern part of the state . Gusts reached 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) at Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory , and the highest gusts in the state was around 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . The winds downed about 50 million board feet of trees in the state , many of which fell onto power lines ; much of eastern Massachusetts lost power during the storm . Carol left about $ 15 million in crop damage in the state . The winds destroyed much of the corn crop , about half of the peach crop , and about 1.5 million bushels of apples . High winds destroyed the spire of the Old North Church in Boston , which was the location of where the lanterns were hung during Paul Revere 's ride . It was a replacement spire , after a hurricane in 1804 destroyed the original . Heavy damage was reported throughout Boston , and in Wareham , about 1,500 people were left homeless . Statewide , 3,350 homes were damaged to some degree , and another 800 were destroyed . The hurricane destroyed another 213 buildings and severely damaged 530 . Near the coast , strong storm surges were reported , and a 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) storm tide was reported at New Bedford , setting a record . At least 15 deaths were reported in the state , and damage was estimated at $ 175 million .\n Carol maintained its intensity as it moved inland , and its winds were strong enough to knock down trees and power lines in New Hampshire . One tree fell onto a car , killing a person , and there were three deaths overall in the state , along with $ 3 million in damage . There was also a death in neighboring Vermont . Carol produced winds of up to 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) in Augusta , Maine . Throughout the state , the winds downed hundreds of trees , some of which damaged houses , wrecked cars , destroyed one building , or fell onto power lines . Fallen trees blocked highways , and one person was injured by a falling tree limb . Downed power lines left several counties without power or telephone services .",
      "Passage": "The hurricane produced a record-high wind gust of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) at Block Island , while on mainland Rhode Island , sustained winds peaked at 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) in Warwick with gusts to 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . Upon making landfall around high tide , Carol produced a storm surge of up to 14.4 feet ( 4.4 m ) in Narragansett Bay , surpassing that of the New England Hurricane of 1938 . The resulting storm surge flooded downtown Providence with 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) of water . News reports indicated that the floods covered the area with 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) in about an hour . The winds downed two broadcasting towers in the city . Westerly was also flooded , where 200 homes were washed away . There was also heavy damage in Newport , where the Newport Casino was damaged . Some entire coastal communities were nearly destroyed , and 620 houses and 83 other buildings were destroyed in the state . The winds destroyed the roofs of hundreds of buildings , forcing many to evacuate to shelters during the passage of the storm . The powerful winds also downed thousands of trees and power lines , blacking out the entire state and interrupting 95 percent of phone service . Damage in the state totaled about $ 200 million , and there were at least 17 deaths in Rhode Island ."

The wind and the water broke many houses and buildings and cars and boats. The people who lived there could not see or talk to each other because the storm broke the wires that gave them light and phone calls. Many people were hurt or died because of the storm. The storm cost a lot of money to fix everything that was broken.",
      "Outcome6": "As the hurricane approached the coast, Block Island recorded a wind gust of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ), the highest ever measured in the state. On the mainland, Warwick experienced sustained winds of 90 mph ( 145 km / h ) with gusts up to 105 mph ( 165 km / h ). The hurricane made landfall around the time of high tide, which amplified the storm surge along the coast. Narragansett Bay saw a surge of up to 14.4 feet ( 4.4 m ), exceeding the previous record set by the New England Hurricane of 1938. This caused severe flooding in downtown Providence, where water levels rose to 12 feet ( 3.7 m ) above normal in some areas. The rapid inundation caught many people off guard, and some reports indicated that water rose by 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) in an hour. The strong winds also toppled two radio towers in the city, disrupting communication. In Westerly, near the border with Connecticut, about 200 homes were swept away by the floodwaters. Newport also suffered heavy damage, especially at the historic Newport Casino, which lost part of its roof and walls. Many coastal communities were devastated by the storm surge and wind damage, and across the state, 620 houses and 83 other buildings were completely destroyed. Hundreds more had their roofs blown off, forcing residents to seek shelter elsewhere during the storm. The hurricane also brought down thousands of trees and power lines throughout Rhode Island, leaving no area with electricity and cutting off phone service for most of the population. The total damage in Rhode Island was estimated at $ 200 million , and at least 17 people lost their lives in the state.",

In June 1944, he took over No. 126 ( Persian Gulf ) Squadron, which also flew Spitfires, and participated in the Allied invasion of France and the subsequent advance across Europe. He attacked enemy airfields, transport and communications targets, and provided close support to ground forces. He was shot down by flak over Arnhem during Operation Market Garden in September 1944, but managed to bale out and escape with minor injuries. After recovering from his ordeal, he converted to flying Mustang IIIs, a more powerful and long-range fighter-bomber. He led a wing based at RAF Bentwaters in Suffolk, which carried out offensive operations against Germany until the end of the war.",

The Responsible Attorney must contact the Court's Division Clerk, Jessica Wichman, at (970) 494-3610 within 14 days from the date of the \"At Issue\" order to schedule the case management conference.

Please use JDF 622.\n16(b)(6), and 26(b)(1).\n For most case types, the Court does not set a trial date until after alternative dispute resolution has been completed. The Parties may request that ADR be waived or that the case be set for trial prior to ADR because of the specific needs of their case; however, good cause must be shown for the request. Please use actual calendar dates for deadlines as trial will not be set.\n Regarding paragraph #14 of JDF 622: The Court does not accept written disputed discovery motions.\n If a dispute about written discovery (requests for production, interrogatories, etc.) s not resolved, the moving party must complete the written discovery dispute chart in the form attached hereto as Appendix A, with the most persuasive authority included. The parties are further directed to contact the Court's Clerk at the number above if they wish to set a hearing on the dispute. The parties shall submit the required materials three days before the hearing.\n The Court expects counsel to confer in a meaningful way in writing, and by telephone or in person to try to resolve any discovery dispute. An exchange of emails is not sufficient. If counsel cannot resolve the dispute, the Court will address all discovery disputes with an in-person discovery hearing. The parties are directed to contact the Court's Clerk at the number above if they wish to set a discovery hearing.\n With respect to written discovery, the Court frowns on \"boilerplate\" objections that fail to provide clear and precise explanations of the legal and factual justifications for the objections as well as a specific description of any information which may be available but is not being provided because of the objection. If a responding party claims to not understand a discovery request or the meaning of any term in a request, then that party shall within 14 days seek clarification of the meaning from counsel who served the discovery. Failure to do so results in waiver of any objection based on the purported lack of understanding. Any response which does not provide the information or requested material but promises to do so in the future will be treated the same as no response unless the responding party provides a specific reason for not producing the information and a specific date when it will produce it.",

      "Left": "Great Eastern Highway is a 590-kilometre-long ( 370 mi ) road that links the Western Australian capital of Perth with the city of Kalgoorlie . A key route for road vehicles accessing the eastern Wheatbelt and the Goldfields , it is the western portion of the main road link between Perth and the eastern states of Australia . The highway forms the majority of National Highway 94 , although the alignment through the Perth suburbs of Guildford and Midland , and the eastern section between Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie are not included . Various segments form parts of other road routes , including National Route 1 , Alternate National Route 94 , and State Route 51 .",
      "Right": "The highway was created in the 1930s from an existing system of roads linking Perth with the Goldfields . Though the name Great Eastern Highway was coined to describe the route from Perth to Guildford on the northern side of the Swan River ( modern-day Guildford Road ) , it was actually used for the road through Belmont , south of the river . This section was constructed in 1867 using convict labour , with the road base made from sections of tree trunks . Over the years the road has been upgraded , with the whole highway sealed by 1953 , segments reconstructed and widened , dual carriageways created in Perth and Kalgoorlie , and grade separated interchanges built at major intersections . Great Eastern Highway Bypass in Perth 's eastern suburbs opened in 1988 , allowing through traffic to avoid the Guildford and Midland townsites , and in 2002 a new bypass diverted the highway around Northam . A future route to replace Great Eastern Highway 's current ascent of the Darling Scarp has been identified . The planned route is a controlled-access highway along Toodyay Road to <unk> , and then across to Wundowie via a new alignment . Though planning began in the 1970s , as of 2012 , construction of this route has not been scheduled , and it is not considered a priority .",
      "Passage": "There are numerous intersections in Perth with other highways and main roads , including Canning , Albany , Tonkin and Roe Highways , and Graham Farmer Freeway . There are also two rural highways that spur off Great Eastern Highway . Great Southern Highway begins near Perth 's eastern metropolitan boundary , linking towns such as York , Brookton , Narrogin , and Katanning . Near the eastern end of the highway , Coolgardie is the starting point of Coolgardie – Esperance Highway , connecting to the interstate route Eyre Highway at Norseman , as well as the coastal town of Esperance ."

The highway also serves as a vital link for tourism and freight between the west and east coasts of Australia. \"Great Eastern Highway is the lifeline of the Goldfields and the Wheatbelt,\" said Kalgoorlie-Boulder Mayor John Bowler in 2018.",

Great Southern Highway begins near Perth 's eastern metropolitan boundary , linking towns such as York , Brookton , Narrogin , and Katanning .

The other one is near where Great Eastern Highway ends , and it goes to a place called Norseman , where you can go to another road that goes all the way across the country . It also goes to a place called Esperance , where they have a nice beach .",
      "Outcome6": "Along its route through Perth and the rural areas of Western Australia , Great Eastern Highway intersects with several other important highways and main roads . Some of these provide access to other regions of the state or alternative routes to the eastern states of Australia . One of these is Canning Highway , which connects Perth with the port city of Fremantle and the south-western suburbs . Another is Albany Highway , which branches off from Great Eastern Highway near Cannington and travels south-east to Albany on the south coast . In the eastern suburbs , Tonkin Highway and Roe Highway form part of a ring road around Perth , linking Great Eastern Highway with other major roads such as Reid Highway , Leach Highway , and Kwinana Freeway . Near the city centre , Graham Farmer Freeway is a tunnel that bypasses the central business district and connects to Mitchell Freeway and Charles Street . Great Eastern Highway also has two rural highways that extend from it in different directions . The first one is Great Southern Highway , which begins near The Lakes , at Perth 's eastern metropolitan boundary . This highway follows a south-easterly route through the Wheatbelt and Great Southern regions , passing through historic towns such as York , Brookton , Narrogin , and Katanning . The second one is Coolgardie – Esperance Highway , which starts in Coolgardie , near the eastern end of Great Eastern Highway . This highway heads south to the coastal town of Esperance , crossing the Norseman – Hyden Road at Norseman . This road is part of Eyre Highway , which continues east across the Nullarbor Plain to South Australia and Victoria .",

      "Right": "The first two years of the Transactional Analysis psychotherapy training provides you with an understanding of the fundamental elements of Transactional Analysis theory and practice and supports you as you begin to work with clients. Students who pass the first two years successfully will either remain on the TA psychotherapy programme or enroll onto the MSc in TA psychotherapy. It is worth noting that despite the slightly higher fee involved in following the MSc route, the vast majority of our students decide to enroll onto the MSc. This is, in part, because of the additional benefits in the job market that an MSc brings and because both routes cover the same content, number of written projects and the same requirements in terms of personal therapy, clinical work and clinical supervision.\n Whichever route you choose, the remaining three years of the course engages you in advanced theoretical discussions and the practice implications arising from these and supports you as you develop and integrate a personal style of Transactional Analysis. In the final year known as the Examination Year, you evidence that integration through a written and oral examination. A more detailed explanation of all four years is given further below.\n Successful completion of all elements of the course, should you follow the MSc route leads to both an MSc in Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy validated by Middlesex University, and a Clinical Diploma in Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy awarded by Metanoia Institute. The clinical diploma also enables you to register with the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) as a qualified psychotherapist with the Humanistic and Integrative College (HIPC). Additionally, you will become a Certified Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy a TA qualification that is awarded by the European Association of Transactional Analysis (EATA) and the possibility of further registration with the European Association for Psychotherapy (EAP). If you opt out of the MSc, you will gain all of the qualifications listed above, other than the MSc.\n Post-graduate student loans, providing you are eligible, are available once you enroll onto the MSc. Likewise, the\nPhilosophical basis of the MSc Programme\nTransactional Analysis, in recognition of its multifaceted nature, is perhaps best described as an integrative approach to psychotherapy. Unlike an \"eclectic\" approach, in which a practitioner chooses the best or most appropriate ideas and techniques from a range of theories and models for an integrative approach, brings together different theories and models, from a variety of approaches and develops them into a new theory or model.",

      "Outcome1": "On this programme, you will learn how to use Transactional Analysis psychotherapy, a way of understanding and helping people with their emotional and relationship problems. You will learn the skills and knowledge you need to work as a psychotherapist with different kinds of clients in different places.\n\nThe programme takes four years to complete. You will come to our institute for one weekend every month for ten months each year. After the first two years, you can choose to continue with the same programme or join another one that gives you a Master's degree as well as a diploma. Most of our students choose the Master's degree because it can help them find better jobs and it does not have more work than the diploma. Both programmes have the same topics, projects and requirements.\n\nIn the last two years, you will learn more advanced ideas and practice of Transactional Analysis psychotherapy and develop your own way of using it. In the final year, you will have to write a paper and do an oral exam to show what you have learned. If you pass everything, depending on which programme you chose, you will get either a Master's degree or a diploma in Transactional Analysis psychotherapy from us and from Middlesex University. You will also get a certificate from the UK Council for Psychotherapy (UKCP) that shows you are a qualified psychotherapist in this approach. You will also get another certificate from the European Association of Transactional Analysis (EATA) that shows you are certified in this approach in Europe.\n\nIf you want to join the Master's degree programme, you may be able to get a loan from the government if you meet some conditions.",
      "Outcome2": "On this programme, you have the option of pursuing either a clinical diploma or an MSc in Transactional Analysis psychotherapy, both of which cover the same core content and requirements. However, most of our students choose the MSc route, as it offers some additional advantages that can enhance your professional development and career prospects. For example, by enrolling onto the MSc route, you will:\n\n- Gain a recognised academic qualification that demonstrates your advanced knowledge and skills in TA psychotherapy and research methods\n- Have access to post-graduate student loans, subject to eligibility criteria\n- Be able to apply for further study opportunities at doctoral level or other specialised areas of TA practice\n- Have more opportunities to network with other MSc students and researchers in the field of TA and psychotherapy\n- Receive additional support and guidance from the MSc team throughout your studies\n\nThe clinical diploma route, on the other hand, is more suitable for those who are not interested in pursuing further academic qualifications or research projects, but still want to obtain a high standard of professional training in TA psychotherapy that leads to UKCP registration and EATA certification.",
      "Outcome3": "Building on the foundation of the first two years, this programme offers post-graduate training in Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy and will provide you with a strong knowledge base and the expertise to practice as a Transactional Analysis psychotherapist with a broad range of clients in a variety of settings.\n\nThe total length of this programme is four taught years and runs for one weekend a month over ten months for the first four years, followed by an examination module.",
      "Outcome4": "On this programme, you will learn and practice Transactional Analysis (TA) psychotherapy, a versatile and integrative approach that works with a wide range of clients and settings. The programme takes four years of monthly weekend teaching, plus an examination module. \n\nAfter two years of basic TA training, you can choose to continue on the TA psychotherapy programme or join the MSc in TA psychotherapy. Most students opt for the MSc, which has a slightly higher fee but also more benefits in terms of academic recognition and employability. Both routes cover the same content and requirements, including personal therapy, clinical work and supervision.\n\nThe last three years of the programme will help you deepen your theoretical knowledge and practice skills in TA and develop your own style as a TA psychotherapist. In the final year, you will take a written and oral examination to demonstrate your integration of TA. \n\nBy completing the programme successfully, you will earn an MSc in TA psychotherapy from Middlesex University and a Clinical Diploma in TA psychotherapy from Metanoia Institute. The diploma also qualifies you to register with UKCP, EATA and EAP as a certified TA psychotherapist. If you do not take the MSc, you will still get all these qualifications except the MSc.\n\nYou can apply for a post-graduate student loan if you are eligible once you enroll on the MSc.",
      "Outcome5": "Do you like to learn new things and help people? Do you want to become a good helper who can talk to people and understand their feelings? Then you might like this course. This course teaches you how to use a special way of talking called Transactional Analysis. It helps you to know yourself better and to help others feel better too. \n\nThis course is very long and fun. You will come to our school for one weekend every month for four years. You will learn a lot of things about Transactional Analysis and how to use it with different people in different places. You will also practice with other students and with real people who need your help.\n\nAfter two years, you can choose if you want to keep learning the same way or if you want to do something extra. If you do something extra, you will get a bigger prize at the end, but you will also have to work harder and pay more money. Most students like to do something extra because they think it is worth it.\n\nIf you finish the whole course, you will get a big prize that says you are very good at Transactional Analysis and that you can help people as a helper. You will also get another prize from a big group of helpers who use Transactional Analysis in Europe. They will say that you are one of them and that they are proud of you.",
      "Outcome6": "On this programme, you will have the opportunity to train as a Transactional Analysis psychotherapist and gain a solid foundation of knowledge and skills in this approach. Transactional Analysis is a theory of personality, communication, and human development that can be applied to various fields of psychotherapy, counselling, education, and organisational development. As a Transactional Analysis psychotherapist, you will be able to work with diverse clients and issues in different settings, using a range of methods and techniques.\n\nThe programme consists of four years of taught modules, followed by an examination module. The modules run for one weekend per month for ten months each year. In the first two years, you will learn the core concepts and principles of Transactional Analysis theory and practice and start to apply them in your clinical work with clients. After completing the first two years successfully, you will have the choice to either continue on the TA psychotherapy programme or switch to the MSc in TA psychotherapy. Most students opt for the latter option because it has many advantages, such as being more recognised in the job market, having access to post-graduate student loans if eligible, and being equivalent in content, projects, and requirements to the TA psychotherapy programme. However, both options lead to the same qualifications at the end of the programme.\n\nThe last three years of the programme are focused on expanding your understanding of advanced Transactional Analysis theory and practice and helping you develop your own style and identity as a Transactional Analysis psychotherapist. You will also prepare for your final examination module in which you will demonstrate your integration of theory and practice through written and oral assessments. By completing all aspects of the programme successfully (or all but one if you choose not to do the MSc), you will obtain an MSc in Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy validated by Middlesex University (if you do the MSc) or a Clinical Diploma in Transactional Analysis Psychotherapy awarded by Metanoia Institute (if you do not do the MSc). Both qualifications enable you to register with UKCP as a qualified psychotherapist with HIPC. You will also become a Certified Transactional Analyst (CTA) which is an international qualification awarded by EATA that allows you to register with EAP as well.",

      "Outcome1": "Another reason why the past is important for people today is that it provides us with the foundation to create new knowledge and innovations. Without the past, we would not have the scientific and technological advances that we enjoy today. For example, according to a study by the National Science Foundation, about 60% of the patents granted in the United States in 2010 were based on prior art, which means they relied on existing knowledge or inventions from the past. Similarly, a survey by the Pew Research Center found that 87% of Americans say that learning about history helps them understand current events better. These examples show that the past is not only a source of inspiration, but also a valuable resource for solving problems and improving our lives.",
      "Outcome2": "Another reason why the past is important is that it provides us with the foundation to create new knowledge and innovations. Without the past discoveries and insights, we would not have the modern civilization we enjoy today. For example, America would not be a global power if Columbus had not stumbled upon it while looking for India. Likewise, contemporary scientists would not be able to study the earth's gravity without Newton's observation of the falling apple. These are just some of the invaluable contributions that the past has given us. We should not disregard them in any way.",
      "Outcome3": "Another reason why the past is important for us today is that it provides us with the foundation to create new things and discover new possibilities. The past is like a treasure chest that contains valuable gems of knowledge and wisdom that we can use to enrich our present and future. Without the past, we would not have the tools and the insights to solve our problems and pursue our dreams. For example, America would not be a powerful nation if Columbus had not stumbled upon it while looking for India. Modern scientists would not be able to study gravity without the apple that sparked Newton's curiosity. These are just some of the many gifts that the past has given us, and we should not take them for granted.",
      "Outcome4": "Moreover, the past is the foundation for creating new knowledge and inventions. Without the past discoveries, we could not enjoy the modern conveniences today. For example, America's global role owes to Columbus's accidental voyage, and the gravity theory stems from Newton's apple incident. These are some of the valuable lessons that the past offers us. We should not disregard them.",
      "Outcome5": "Another thing is, the past helps us learn new things and make new things. If we did not know what happened before, we would not know how to do many things now. For example, someone found a new place a long time ago, and now many people live there. Another person saw a fruit fall from a tree, and he learned why things fall down. These are some of the things that the past teaches us. We should not forget them.",
      "Outcome6": "Another reason why the past is important for people today is that it provides us with a foundation to build upon new knowledge and innovations. Without the past, we would not have the achievements and advancements that we enjoy today. For example, America would not be the world's superpower if Columbus had not stumbled upon it while looking for India. Likewise, modern scientists would not be able to study the earth's gravity without Newton's observation of the falling apple. These are just some of the many valuable pieces of information that the past offers us. We should not disregard them or take them for granted.",

      "Left": "New paragraphs:\nWe have experienced momentous events in the last twenty years: the relative decline of the United States' economy, the dramatic revival of China, and a sense of threat for the world's democracies. In China, President Xi Jinping has been elected leader of his country for life, a reminder of its last life-long ruler Chairman Mao who, after his military triumphs, tended to preside over chaos.\n In the democratic USA, Mr Trump is seen by many as another threat to democracy. North Korea, sitting like a noisy bird on the shoulders of both Trump and Xi Jinping, heightens the tension. Suddenly the fear of both a nuclear war and a destructive trade war have emerged. On present indications both fears are probably exaggerated. We can't penetrate the minds nor read the incoming emails of the two most powerful leaders: we can only speculate.",
      "Right": "The period between 1945 and 1970 remained disturbing for the democratic world. The USA was a mighty power, a vital defender of democracy, but still vulnerable. A dreadful phase was the tense confrontation - the nuclear-missile crisis in Cuba in 1962 - when John F. Kennedy was president of the United States.\n I am not recalling the start of the Cold War in order to minimise the present confrontation between the United States and China - a situation seen by some as potentially a Second Cold War. This year's daily news is a legitimate cause for concern. As Australians we are especially concerned because we view China as lying in our corner of the globe. In contrast, in 1950, Stalin's Moscow seemed tucked away behind the Iron Curtain.\n It might be argued that the relatively close relationship between China and Australia today, and the huge flow of commerce and tourism between the two nations is a factor for peace. But countries can enjoy the most intimate links and still quarrel and even declare war. On the eve of the First World War, England and Germany had intimate links. The powerful Kaiser Wilhelm 11 of Germany was a grandson of Queen Victoria of England. The head of the German army, the strongest in Europe, had educated his daughter at an English boarding school. In scholarship, culture and science the links between Germany and England were intimate. Even Australia and Germany had close commercial links in 1914. Many critics mistakenly said that the First World War simply could not occur, or would be ended quickly, because the major nations depended intimately on each other in commerce and finance.\n If the relationship between China and the United States should enter a thorny period that lasts, say, for 20 years, Australian governments might have to make difficult choices, both in trading alliances and in military alliances. Whose side will we be on? No doubt Canberra will make those choices, as best it can. But any decision will be strongly affected - or even reversed - by decisions made in Washington and Beijing. They will decide whether we are important to them. Researchers sometimes tell us - mistakenly - that in our national crisis of January 1942, when Japanese forces were at our front gate - Mr John Curtin, our wartime prime minister, helped to persuade the USA instead of Britain to come to our aid. On the contrary the USA made that decision, unaided, with its own interests to the fore.\n A smallish or middle-ranking democracy needs allies.",
      "Passage": "May I offer a perspective. The quick rise of China is like the quick rise to world prominence of the Soviet Union in the 1940s. It creates fear; it threatens to reshape our world.\nThe rise of the Soviet Union was probably the more disturbing of those two events. Its huge army had shown its strength by capturing nearly all of eastern Europe and some of central Europe. It was about to make its own nuclear weapons and to enter the space race: remember, the first human face in space was Russian. Meanwhile the victory of the communists in China in 1949 seemed indirectly to challenge democracy everywhere, for an unbroken red zone now stretched almost from the outskirts of Hong Kong to the border of Italy, from the Pacific Ocean to the Adriatic and the Baltic. Few predicted, however, that communist China and communist Russia would quarrel so quickly; but indeed within a decade they were ideological enemies."

The communist victory in China in 1949 seemed to threaten democracy everywhere, as a vast red zone stretched from Hong Kong to Italy, from the Pacific to the Adriatic and the Baltic. But China and Russia soon became ideological foes.",
      "Outcome5": "Let me tell you a story. A long time ago, there was a big country called the Soviet Union that wanted to be the boss of the world. It had a lot of soldiers and weapons and it took over many smaller countries. This made another big country called the United States very scared and angry, because it liked freedom and democracy. The United States also had a lot of soldiers and weapons, and it tried to stop the Soviet Union from taking over more countries. They did not fight directly, but they were always ready to fight. This was called the Cold War.\n\nNow there is another big country called China that is becoming very strong and rich. It also wants to be the boss of the world, or at least of its own region. This makes the United States scared and angry again, because it thinks China does not respect freedom and democracy. China also has a lot of soldiers and weapons, and it is trying to control more land and sea around it. The United States is trying to stop China from doing that. They have not fought yet, but they might fight in the future. Some people say this is like another Cold War.",
      "Outcome6": "Let me offer a perspective that might help us understand the current situation better. The rapid ascent of China to a global power is similar to the sudden emergence of the Soviet Union as a world force in the 1940s. Both events triggered fear and anxiety among the established democracies; both events seemed to herald a new world order that challenged their values and interests.\nThe rise of the Soviet Union was arguably more alarming than that of China today. Its massive army had demonstrated its prowess by conquering most of eastern and parts of central Europe. It was on the verge of developing its own nuclear weapons and launching its own satellites: recall, the first human being in space was a Soviet cosmonaut. Meanwhile, the victory of the communists in China in 1949 appeared to be an indirect threat to democracy everywhere, as a vast red bloc now extended from near Hong Kong to the borders of Italy, from the Pacific Ocean to the Adriatic and the Baltic seas. Few foresaw, however, that communist China and communist Russia would soon fall out with each other; but indeed within a decade they were ideological rivals.",

Kennedy International Airport in New York City , killing all 100 passengers and 9 crew members on board the flight , and 4 people on the ground . It was the only fatal accident involving Concorde .\n According to the official investigation conducted by the Bureau d 'Enquêtes et d 'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l 'Aviation Civile ( BEA ) , the crash was caused by a metallic strip that fell from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off minutes earlier . This fragment punctured a tyre on Concorde 's left main wheel bogie during take-off . The tyre exploded , and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank , which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire . The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning , and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power , the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed . The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent , rolling left and crashing tail-low into the <unk> Les <unk> Bleus Hotel in <unk> .\n The claim that a metallic strip caused the crash was disputed during the trial both by witnesses ( including the pilot of Jacques Chirac 's aircraft that had just landed on an adjacent runway when Flight 4590 caught fire ) and by an independent French TV investigation that found a wheel spacer had not been installed in the left-side main gear and that the plane caught fire some 1,000 feet from where the metallic strip lay .\n On 6 December 2010 , Continental Airlines and John Taylor , one of its mechanics , were found guilty of involuntary manslaughter , but on 30 November 2012 , a French court overturned the conviction , saying mistakes by Continental and Taylor did not make them criminally responsible .",

      "Passage": "Prior to the accident , Concorde had been arguably the safest operational passenger airliner in the world in passenger deaths-per-kilometres travelled with zero , but there had been two prior non-fatal accidents and a rate of tyre damage some 30 times higher than subsonic airliners from 1995 to 2000 . Safety improvements were made in the wake of the crash , including more secure electrical controls , Kevlar lining on the fuel tanks and specially developed burst-resistant tyres . The first flight with the modifications departed from London Heathrow on 17 July 2001 , piloted by BA Chief Concorde Pilot Mike Bannister . During the 3-hour 20-minute flight over the mid-Atlantic towards Iceland , Bannister attained Mach 2.02 and 60,000 ft ( 18,000 m ) before returning to RAF <unk> Norton . The test flight , intended to resemble the London – New York route , was declared a success and was watched on live TV , and by crowds on the ground at both locations ."

The first flight with the modifications departed from London Heathrow on 17 July 2001, piloted by BA Chief Concorde Pilot Mike Bannister. During the 3-hour 20-minute flight over the mid-Atlantic towards Iceland, Bannister attained Mach 2.02 and 60,000 ft (18,000 m) before returning to RAF Brize Norton. The test flight, intended to resemble the London – New York route, was declared a success and was watched on live TV, and by crowds on the ground at both locations.\n\"It was a very emotional moment for everyone on board,\" said Bannister after landing. \"We wanted to show the world that Concorde is back and that it is safe and reliable.\"",
      "Outcome2": "After the accident, several safety enhancements were implemented on Concorde to prevent a similar incident from happening again. These included installing more robust electrical wiring, lining the fuel tanks with Kevlar to reduce the risk of punctures, and developing new tyres that could withstand higher impacts and temperatures. The modified Concorde aircraft underwent extensive testing and certification before returning to service. The first flight with the new features took off from London Heathrow on 17 July 2001, with BA Chief Concorde Pilot Mike Bannister at the controls. He flew the supersonic jet over the Atlantic Ocean towards Iceland, reaching a speed of Mach 2.02 and an altitude of 60,000 ft (18,000 m). The flight was a success and was broadcast live on TV, as well as witnessed by spectators on the ground in both countries.",

The test flight , which simulated the London – New York route , was a success and attracted a lot of attention from live TV and crowds on the ground at both locations .",
      "Outcome4": "After the crash, Concorde got safety upgrades like better electrical controls, Kevlar fuel tanks and stronger tyres. The first modified flight was on 17 July 2001 from London to Iceland and back, reaching Mach 2.02 and 60,000 ft (18,000 m). It was a successful test flight watched live on TV and by people on the ground.",
      "Outcome5": "After the crash, people wanted to make Concorde safer. They changed some things on the plane, like the wires, the tanks and the tyres. They made them stronger and better. Then they tried to fly Concorde again, with no passengers, only the pilots. They went very fast and very high, and came back safely. People on TV and on the ground watched them and were happy.",
      "Outcome6": "Before the accident , Concorde had a reputation of being one of the safest passenger airliners in the world , as it had never experienced a fatal crash in its 31 years of service . However , it also had some safety issues that were not widely known , such as two previous incidents that resulted in serious damage but no casualties , and a high rate of tyre damage that was 30 times more frequent than on other aircraft types from 1995 to 2000 . In response to the accident , several safety improvements were implemented on the remaining Concordes , including more secure electrical controls to prevent fire hazards , Kevlar lining on the fuel tanks to reduce the risk of puncture and leakage , and specially developed burst-resistant tyres to avoid tyre debris . The first flight with these modifications took place on 17 July 2001 , with British Airways Chief Concorde Pilot Mike Bannister at the controls . The flight was a test flight that simulated the typical London – New York route , flying over the mid-Atlantic towards Iceland at Mach 2.02 and 60,000 ft ( 18,000 m ) before returning to RAF <unk> Norton . The flight was a success and was broadcast live on TV , and also attracted large crowds of spectators on the ground at both locations .",

The minimum hourly wage is $7.50 per hour. Starting January 1, 2017, the minimum hourly wage is $9.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2018, the minimum hourly wage is $10.00 per hour; starting January 1, 2019, the minimum hourly wage is $11.00 per hour; and starting January 1, 2020, the minimum hourly wage is $12.00 per hour. On January 1, 2021 and each January 1st thereafter, the minimum hourly wage then in effect must be increased by the increase, if any, in the cost of living.\n Tip credit. An employer may consider tips as part of the wages of a service employee, but such a tip credit may not exceed 50% of the minimum hourly wage established in this section except that from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the minimum cash wage paid directly to a tipped service employee may not be less than $5.00 per hour. An employer who elects to use the tip credit must inform the affected employee in advance, as provided for in this subsection, and must be able to show that the employee receives at least the minimum hourly wage when direct wages and the tip credit are combined within the established 7-day workweek. Upon a satisfactory showing by the employee or the employee's representative that the actual tips received were less than the tip credit, the employer shall increase the direct wages by the difference.\n The tips received by a service employee become the property of the employee and may not be shared with the employer. Tips that are automatically included in the customer's bill or that are charged to a credit card must be treated like tips given to the service employee. A tip that is charged to a credit card must be paid by the employer to the employee by the next regular payday and may not be held while the employer is awaiting reimbursement from a credit card company.

      "Left": "The methodologies discussed in this paper are protected under existing and pending patents in the U.S. and other countries.\n Income-producing real estate has long been an important component of institutional investment portfolios. Indeed, stocks and bonds were the original \"alternative\" asset classes for investors whose wealth would otherwise have been almost exclusively real estate.\n This underallocation to the real estate asset class is particularly surprising given what appear to be extraordinarily strong risk-adjusted returns for commercial properties as well as extraordinarily low correlations between commercial properties and other asset classes.\n Several possible reasons for the relative underallocation to the real estate asset class, in the face of such attractive investment attributes, include the following:\n- Commercial property returns are extraordinarily difficult to measure, and are insufficient to compensate for uncertainty regarding true returns, true volatilities, and true correlations with other portfolio assets.\n- Commercial properties are extraordinarily illiquid, and produce returns insufficient to compensate investors for the associated illiquidity risks.\n- Investment-grade commercial properties are extraordinarily non-granular, and produce returns insufficient to compensate investors for the disadvantages of non-scalability.\n- Commercial property investors cannot use short-sales, options, futures, or other risk management tools, and returns are insufficient to compensate for the inadequacies in risk management capabilities.\n To the extent that these shortcomings explain the relative underallocation to the real estate asset class by institutional investors, the implication is that an approach to real estate investing that combined accurate return measurement, liquidity, granularity, and access to risk management tools could be expected to result in greater institutional allocations.\n Such an approach does exist in the common stocks of exchange-traded equity real estate investment trusts (REITs), assets whose values are determined primarily by the value of the portfolio of the commercial properties owned by each REIT. Investing in exchange-traded REITs combines accurate return measurement (based on multiple homogeneous transactions throughout each market day), liquidity (average daily dollar trading volume of about $4.3 billion since January 2007), and granularity (typical single-share prices less than $100), with access to short-sales, options, futures, and other risk management tools.\n However, exchange-traded REITs have not been widely adopted by institutional investors as a means of gaining exposure to the real estate asset class. Several possible reasons for this include the following:",
      "Right": "Market-testing of the PureProperty series, however, revealed two methodological issues that, while not affecting the value of the indices for informational and benchmarking purposes, would severely constrain their applicability for investment purposes. This paper outlines the methodological issues and proposes solutions that are expected to produce a fully investable version of the PureProperty index series, potentially addressing many of the problems that may have retarded the growth of institutional investment in the real estate asset class. After presenting the revised index methodology we consider some prospective uses of the PureProperty index series for risk management purposes in real estate portfolios.\n The HCGP PureProperty Methodology\nStocks are derivative assets whose market values are driven by the market values of the assets held by the company. Put simply, it is relatively easy to enumerate, describe, and value the assets from whose values REIT stock prices derive.\n If the relevant asset groups consist, for example, of six property types common in institutional portfolios, then (following HCGP)\ndenotes the unlevered change in stock price for REIT i during period t\ndenotes the common (systematic) change in the market values for properties of type k during period t, and\nencompasses idiosyncratic sources of change in the unlevered stock price for REIT i during period t. Similarly, if the relevant asset groups consist of the four regions of the U.S., then\nwhere the subscripts denote East, Midwest, South, and West and\nrepresent the change in market values of asset groups that are held across multiple REITs during period t, then we can estimate them by regression using data from the entire collection of REIT constituents:\ns a Kx1 vector giving the common (systematic) percent return on assets during period t for each asset group k; and\ns an Nx1 vector of unsystematic sources of return.\n It is reasonable for several reasons to suppose that the relationships described in equations (1) and (2) will hold more precisely for larger than for smaller REITs: for example, larger REITs are more likely to be followed by a robust community of equity analysts, and more likely to be held by sophisticated institutional investors who may be more skilled at evaluating the values of individual properties and assigning the correct derivative values to the REIT stock prices.",
      "Passage": "- Listed equity REIT investments have much greater volatility than is reported for private real estate, and their returns are insufficient to compensate investors for the difference in volatilities.\n- Listed equity REITs manage their capital structures without significant input from their investors, and institutional investors may have preferences for less-leveraged investments.\n- Listed equity REIT portfolios may be diversified by property type, and institutional investors may prefer property exposures that are targeted by property type.\n- Listed equity REIT portfolios typically are geographically diversified, and institutional investors may prefer property exposures that are geographically targeted."

      "Outcome1": "However, exchange-traded REITs have not been widely embraced by institutional investors as a means of accessing the real estate asset class. Several possible reasons for this reluctance include the following:\n- Listed equity REIT investments exhibit much higher volatility than the reported volatility of private real estate, and their returns are inadequate to compensate investors for the discrepancy in risk levels.\n- Listed equity REITs manage their capital structures without substantial input from their investors, and institutional investors may have preferences for less-leveraged investments.\n- Listed equity REIT portfolios may be diversified by property type, and institutional investors may prefer property exposures that are more selective by property type.\n- Listed equity REIT portfolios typically are geographically diversified, and institutional investors may prefer property exposures that are more focused geographically.",
      "Outcome2": "However, many institutional investors do not use exchange-traded REITs to invest in the real estate market. Some possible reasons for this are:\n\n- Exchange-traded REITs change in price more often and more sharply than private real estate, and their returns may not be enough to make up for this higher risk.\n- Exchange-traded REITs borrow money to buy more properties, and institutional investors may not like this strategy.\n- Exchange-traded REITs own different kinds of properties, and institutional investors may want to focus on specific kinds of properties.\n- Exchange-traded REITs own properties in different areas of the country, and institutional investors may want to focus on specific areas.",
      "Outcome3": "However, there are significant differences between listed equity REITs and private real estate that may affect the preferences of institutional investors. Some of these differences are:\n\n- Volatility: Listed equity REITs are subject to market fluctuations and sentiment, which may increase their volatility and divergence from underlying property values. Private real estate is valued infrequently and based on appraisal methods, which may smooth out volatility and mask true risks.\n- Leverage: Listed equity REITs have varying degrees of leverage, which may amplify their returns or losses depending on the interest rate environment and the performance of their properties. Private real estate investors can choose their own leverage level according to their risk tolerance and return objectives.\n- Property type: Listed equity REITs tend to diversify their portfolios across different property types, such as office, retail, industrial, residential, etc. This may reduce their exposure to specific sector risks and increase their correlation with the overall economy. Private real estate investors can focus on specific property types that match their investment strategy and market outlook.\n- Geography: Listed equity REITs also tend to diversify their portfolios geographically, spanning multiple regions or even countries. This may reduce their exposure to local market risks and increase their correlation with global factors. Private real estate investors can target specific regions or markets that offer attractive opportunities or competitive advantages.",
      "Outcome4": "Some possible barriers to institutional adoption of listed REITs are:\n- Higher volatility than private real estate, with inadequate returns to compensate\n- Lack of control over REITs' leverage decisions\n- Diversification by property type, rather than specialization\n- Diversification by geography, rather than focus",
      "Outcome5": "Some people buy and sell buildings that make money, like offices or malls. These buildings are called real estate. Sometimes, people also buy and sell pieces of paper that say they own part of a company that has many buildings. These pieces of paper are called REITs. REITs change in price every day, depending on how much people want to pay for them. But the price of the buildings does not change every day, because it is harder to know how much they are worth. We want to find a way to measure how much the buildings are worth, without looking at the prices of the REITs. We do this by looking at what kinds of buildings each company has, and where they are located. For example, some companies have more offices in the East, and some have more malls in the South. We use math to figure out how much each kind of building in each place is worth, based on how much money they make and how many people want them. This way, we can compare different kinds of real estate and see which ones are better to invest in.",
      "Outcome6": "Some of the possible reasons why institutional investors have not embraced listed equity REITs as a way to gain exposure to the real estate asset class are as follows:\n- The volatility of listed equity REIT returns is much higher than the reported volatility of private real estate returns, and the expected returns from listed equity REITs may not be high enough to compensate investors for taking on more risk.\n- Listed equity REITs have their own capital structure decisions, which may not align with the preferences of institutional investors who may want to have more control over the level of leverage in their real estate investments.\n- Listed equity REITs tend to diversify their portfolios across different property types, which may not match the desired property type exposure of institutional investors who may have specific views or objectives for each property type.\n- Listed equity REITs also tend to diversify their portfolios geographically, which may not suit the preferences of institutional investors who may want to target certain regions or markets for their real estate investments.",

      "Outcome2": "Leslie faces off with her former friend and current nemesis, Lindsay Carlisle Shay, who is the parks director of the wealthy town of Eagleton and who has erected a fence on the border of a shared park. Meanwhile, Leslie tries to throw a surprise birthday party for Ron, who hates surprises and parties. The episode was penned by Emily Spivey and helmed by Nicole Holofcener. Parker Posey guest starred as Lindsay, who used to be Leslie's best friend until she betrayed her and moved to Eagleton. Posey had been a fan of Parks and Recreation and Amy Poehler for a long time, and was eager to join the show. She finally got her chance in this episode, where she played a snooty and condescending version of Leslie.\n\nThe episode featured a physical confrontation between Leslie and Lindsay in a garbage dump, where they exchanged insults and punches. The scene was performed by stuntwomen in extreme heat conditions. \"You're just jealous because I have everything you want: money, looks, a park system that isn't run by raccoons,\" Lindsay taunted Leslie. \"You're not better than me, Lindsay! You're just meaner! And richer! And better dressed!\" Leslie shouted back.\n\nThe episode also explored the friendship between Leslie and Ron, who have very different personalities but respect each other deeply. The writers had planned to reveal Ron's ideal birthday since the beginning of the show. It turned out to be very simple: he wanted to eat steak alone in his office while watching his favorite movie. Leslie respected his wishes and arranged for him to do so, while also giving him a personalized gift: a new saxophone for his alter ego Duke Silver. \"Leslie,\" Ron said sincerely, \"this is without question the best present I have ever received or will ever receive.\" \"Ron,\" Leslie replied warmly, \"you are a wonderful person and my best friend.\" Michael Schur, the co-creator of the show, called this scene his favorite of the season.\n\n\"Eagleton\" also featured appearances by Eric Pierpoint as Pawnee's police chief Hugh Trumple and Mike Scully as an Eagletonian protester.

Leslie does not like that. Leslie also wants to make Ron happy on his birthday, but Ron does not like parties. She makes a secret party for him anyway.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main plot points of the episode involves a conflict between Leslie and her former friend Lindsay Carlisle Shay, who is now the parks director of Eagleton, a wealthy and snobbish town that borders Pawnee. Lindsay decides to build a fence that cuts through a park that is shared by both towns, claiming that it is to keep out the trash from Pawnee. Leslie is outraged by this act of hostility and confronts Lindsay, who reveals that she has become arrogant and superficial after living in Eagleton. The two end up having a physical altercation among heaps of garbage that are dumped on the park by Pawnee's sanitation department. The fight scene was filmed with stunt doubles for Amy Poehler and Parker Posey, who played Leslie and Lindsay respectively. The scene was challenging to shoot because it was very hot, with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.\n\nThe episode also features a subplot in which Leslie tries to throw a surprise birthday party for Ron, despite his hatred of such events. Leslie learns from Ron's mother that his ideal birthday would involve watching his favorite movie, eating a steak and drinking scotch in solitude. Leslie respects Ron's wishes and arranges for him to have his perfect birthday in her office, while distracting him with a fake scavenger hunt. The idea of Ron's birthday had been planned by the Parks and Recreation writers since the early stages of the show's creation. Michael Schur, the co-creator of the show, said that he loved the final scene in which Leslie and Ron express their mutual respect and admiration for each other, calling it his favorite scene of the season. \"Eagleton\" also includes a guest appearance by Eric Pierpoint as Hugh Trumple, the chief of police in Pawnee, who has a grudge against Andy for crashing into his car.

Under Cunard 's new chairman , John Burns ( 1839 – 1900 ) , son of one of the firm 's original founders , Cunard commissioned four steel-hulled express liners beginning with Servia of 1881 , the first passenger liner with electric lighting throughout . In 1884 , Cunard purchased the almost new Blue Riband winner Oregon from the Guion Line when that firm defaulted on payments to the shipyard . That year , Cunard also commissioned the record-breakers Umbria and Etruria capable of 19.5 knots ( 36.1 km / h ) . Starting in 1887 , Cunard 's newly won leadership on the North Atlantic was threatened when Inman and then White Star responded with twin screw record-breakers . In 1893 Cunard countered with two even faster Blue Riband winners , Campania and Lucania , capable of 21.8 knots ( 40.4 km / h ) .\n No sooner had Cunard re-established its supremacy than new rivals emerged . Beginning in the late 1860s several German firms commissioned liners that were almost as fast as the British mail steamers from Liverpool . In 1897 Kaiser Wilhelm der Große of Norddeutscher Lloyd raised the Blue Riband to 22.3 knots ( 41.3 km / h ) , and was followed by a succession of German record-breakers . Rather than match the new German <unk> , White Star – a rival which Cunard line would merge with – commissioned four very profitable Celtic-class liners of more moderate speed for its secondary Liverpool-New York service . In 1902 White Star joined the well-capitalized American combine , the International Mercantile Marine Co . ( IMM ) , which owned the American Line , including the old Inman Line , and other lines . IMM also had trade agreements with Hamburg – America and Norddeutscher Lloyd .",
      "Right": "Not to be outdone , both White Star and Hamburg – America each ordered a trio of superliners . The White Star Olympic-class liners at 21.5 knots ( 39.8 km / h ) and the Hapag Imperator-class liners at 22.5 knots ( 41.7 km / h ) were larger and more luxurious than the <unk> , but not as fast . Cunard also ordered a new ship , Aquitania , capable of 24.0 knots ( 44.4 km / h ) , to complete the Liverpool mail fleet . Events prevented the expected competition between the three sets of superliners . White Star 's Titanic sank on its maiden voyage , both White Star 's Britannic and Cunard 's Lusitania were war losses , and the three Hapag super-liners were handed over to the Allied powers as war reparations .\n In 1916 Cunard Line completed its European headquarters in Liverpool , moving in on 12 June of that year . The grand neo-Classical Cunard Building was the third of Liverpool 's Three Graces . The headquarters were used by Cunard until the 1960s .\n Due to First World War losses , Cunard began a post-war rebuilding programme including eleven intermediate liners . It acquired the former Hapag Imperator ( renamed the Berengaria ) to replace the lost Lusitania as the running mate for Mauretania and Aquitania , and Southampton replaced Liverpool as the British destination for the three-ship express service . By 1926 Cunard 's fleet was larger than before the war , and White Star was in decline , having been sold by IMM .\n Despite the dramatic reduction in North Atlantic passengers caused by the shipping depression beginning in 1929 , the Germans , Italians and the French commissioned new \" ships of state \" prestige liners . The German Bremen took the Blue Riband at 27.8 knots ( 51.5 km / h ) in 1933 , the Italian Rex recorded 28.9 knots ( 53.5 km / h ) on a westbound voyage the same year , and the French Normandie crossed the Atlantic in just under four days at 30.58 knots ( 56.63 km / h ) in 1937 .",
      "Passage": "This was the Dreadnought era and British prestige was at stake . The British Government provided Cunard with an annual subsidy of £ 150,000 plus a low interest loan of £ 2.5 million ( equivalent to £ 243 million in 2015 ) , to pay for the construction of the two superliners , the Blue Riband winners Lusitania and Mauretania , capable of 26.0 knots ( 48.2 km / h ) . In 1903 the firm started a Fiume – New York service with calls at Italian ports and Gibraltar . The next year Cunard commissioned two ships to compete directly with the Celtic-class liners on the secondary Liverpool-New York route . In 1911 Cunard entered the St Lawrence trade by purchasing the Thompson line , and absorbed the Royal line five years later ."

      "Outcome1": "## Cunard's Subsidized Superliners and the Blue Riband Race\nThis was the Dreadnought era and British prestige was at stake . The British Government provided Cunard with an annual subsidy of £ 150,000 plus a low interest loan of £ 2.5 million ( equivalent to £ 243 million in 2015 ) , to pay for the construction of the two superliners , the Blue Riband winners Lusitania and Mauretania , capable of 26.0 knots ( 48.2 km / h ) .

      "Outcome2": "During this period of intense competition, Cunard received financial support from the British Government to build two superliners that would surpass the speed and size of their rivals. The result was the Lusitania and Mauretania, which both won the Blue Riband for their record-breaking crossings of 26.0 knots (48.2 km/h). These ships offered unprecedented levels of comfort and luxury for their passengers, who enjoyed spacious cabins, elegant dining rooms, and various amenities such as libraries, gyms, and smoking rooms. The crew also benefited from improved working conditions and wages compared to other liners. However, these superliners also faced some challenges, such as high fuel consumption, frequent mechanical problems, and vulnerability to enemy attacks during wartime.",
      "Outcome3": "Britain wanted to have the best ships . The government gave Cunard money to build two very fast liners , Lusitania and Mauretania . They could go 26.0 knots ( 48.2 km / h ) and won the Blue Riband . In 1903 Cunard started a new service from Fiume to New York . It stopped at some ports in Italy and Gibraltar . In 1904 Cunard built two more ships to go on the other Liverpool-New York service . In 1911 Cunard bought another line to go to Canada . It bought another line in 1916 .",
      "Outcome4": "With British pride at stake, the government subsidized Cunard to build two fast superliners, Lusitania and Mauretania, that won the Blue Riband at 26.0 knots (48.2 km/h). Cunard also expanded its services to Fiume, the St Lawrence, and Southampton.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people in England wanted to have the fastest and biggest boats to carry people across the ocean. They got money from their government to build two very fast boats, Lusitania and Mauretania, that could go faster than any other boat. They also started a new route to Canada with some other boats they bought. But then some other countries also wanted to have fast and big boats, and they built their own. One of them was called Titanic, but it hit an iceberg and sank on its first trip. Some of the other boats were also lost or given away because of a big war that happened.",
      "Outcome6": "As a response to the growing competition from German and American lines, the British Government decided to support Cunard with financial aid to build a new generation of superliners. The Government offered Cunard an annual subsidy of £ 150,000 plus a low interest loan of £ 2.5 million ( equivalent to £ 243 million in 2015 ) , on the condition that the new ships would be fast enough to win back the Blue Riband and serve as auxiliary cruisers in wartime. Cunard accepted the deal and commissioned two magnificent ships, Lusitania and Mauretania, which were launched in 1906 and 1907 respectively. Both ships were powered by steam turbines and could achieve speeds of over 26.0 knots ( 48.2 km / h ) , breaking the previous records held by the German liners. Lusitania and Mauretania dominated the North Atlantic for a decade, earning fame and prestige for Cunard.\n\nCunard also expanded its services to other routes in this period. In 1903 it started a service from Fiume, then part of Austria-Hungary, to New York, calling at various ports in Italy and Gibraltar along the way. This service catered to the growing emigration from Southern Europe to America. In 1904 Cunard added two more ships, Caronia and Carmania, to compete with White Star's Celtic-class liners on the secondary Liverpool-New York route. These ships were slightly slower but larger and more comfortable than their predecessors. In 1911 Cunard entered the Canadian market by purchasing the Thompson line, which operated a service from Liverpool to Montreal via Quebec City during the summer months and Halifax during the winter months. Cunard absorbed another Canadian line, Royal line, in 1916.",

      "Left": "The design of the Royal Sovereign-class ships was derived from that of the Admiral-class ironclad battleships , greatly enlarged to improve seakeeping and to provide space for a secondary armament as in the preceding Trafalgar-class ironclad battleships . The ships displaced 14,150 long tons ( 14,380 t ) at normal load and 15,580 long tons ( 15,830 t ) at deep load . They had a length between perpendiculars of 380 feet ( 115.8 m ) and an overall length of 410 feet 6 inches ( 125.1 m ) , a beam of 75 feet ( 22.9 m ) , and a draught of 27 feet 6 inches ( 8.4 m ) . Their crew consisted of 670 officers and ratings in 1903 .",
      "Right": "Their main armament consisted of four breech-loading ( BL ) 13.5-inch ( 343 mm ) guns mounted in two twin-gun barbettes , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . Each gun was provided with 80 rounds . Their secondary armament consisted of ten quick-firing ( QF ) 6-inch ( 152 mm ) guns . 200 rounds per gun were carried by the ships . Sixteen QF 6-pounder ( 2.2 in ( 57 mm ) ) and a dozen QF 3-pounder ( 1.9 in ( 47 mm ) ) Hotchkiss guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats . The two 3-pounders in the upper fighting top were removed in 1899 – 1902 and all of the remaining light guns from the lower fighting tops and main deck followed in 1905 – 09 . The Royal Sovereign-class ships mounted seven 18-inch ( 450 mm ) torpedo tubes , although Royal Oak had four of hers removed in 1902 .\n The Royal Sovereigns ' armour scheme was similar to that of the Trafalgars , as the waterline belt of compound armour only protected the area between the barbettes . The 14 – 18-inch ( 356 – 457 mm ) belt was 238 feet ( 72.5 m ) long and had a total height of 8 feet 8 inches ( 2.6 m ) of which 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) was below water . Transverse bulkheads 14 – 16 inches ( 356 – 406 mm ) thick closed off the ends of the belt . Above the belt was a strake of 4-inch ( 102 mm ) nickel-steel armour closed off by 3-inch ( 76 mm ) transverse bulkheads .\n The barbettes were protected by compound armour , ranging in thickness from 11 to 17 inches ( 279 to 432 mm ) , and the casemates for the 6-inch guns were protected by armour equally thick . The thicknesses of the deck armour ranged from 2.5 to 3 inches ( 64 to 76 mm ) . The walls of the forward conning tower were 12 – 14 inches ( 305 – 356 mm ) thick and the aft conning tower was protected by 3-inch plates .",

These guns were powerful weapons that could fire a shell weighing 1,250 pounds ( 567 kg ) at a muzzle velocity of 2,050 feet per second ( 620 m / s ) . The guns had a maximum elevation of +13 degrees , which gave them a range of about 12,000 yards ( 11,000 m ) .

The cost of each ship's machinery was about £110,000 . The construction of the Royal Sovereign-class ships began in 1889 and they were completed by 1894 . They were built by various naval dockyards and private contractors , with some variations in their details and fittings .",

He proposed to her at the end of September and they were married on November 5 of that year at the First United Methodist Church in Midland , the same church in which she had been baptized . Laura bought a tan , two-toned dress off the rack for the wedding . The couple honeymooned in Cozumel , Mexico . George W. Bush detailed his choice to marry Laura as the \" best decision of my life . \" Laura , an only child , said she gained \" brothers and sisters and wonderful in-laws \" who all accepted her after she wed George W. Bush .\n The year after their marriage , the couple began campaigning for George W. Bush 's 1978 Congressional candidacy . According to George Bush , when he asked her to marry him , she had said , \" Yes . But only if you promise me that I 'll never have to make a campaign speech . \" She soon relented , and gave her first stump speech for him in 1978 on the courthouse steps in Muleshoe , Texas . After narrowly winning the primary , he lost the general election .",
      "Right": "The Bushes had tried to conceive for three years , but pregnancy did not happen easily . On November 25 , 1981 , Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters , Barbara and Jenna .

The twins graduated from high school in 2000 and attended Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin , respectively , in 2004 . To date , Bush is the only First Lady to have given birth to twins .\n George W. Bush credited his wife with his decision to stop drinking in 1986 . She reflected that she thought her husband \" was drinking too much \" amid her knowing it was not his desired way of living . Approaching him , she related that her father had been alcoholic and it was not a pattern she wished to repeat in their family . She is also credited with having a stabilizing effect on his private life . According to People magazine reporter Jane Simms Podesta , \" She is the steel in his back . She is a civilizing influence on him . I think she built him , in many ways , into the person he is today . \" \n  Bush traveled to Kuwait in April 1993 , accompanying her father-in-law and mother-in-law as well as brothers-in-law Jeb and Marvin Bush after former President Bush was invited to return to the Middle East for the first time since his presidency .\n Several times a year , Bush and her husband travel to their sprawling family estate , the Bush compound , better known as Walker 's Point . Located in Kennebunkport , Maine , the compound is where Bush family gatherings have been held for nearly 100 years .",

      "Left": "It's wonderful to have you here. Thank you so much for being with us today, Janmejaya.\n Let me begin by saying that it is my firm belief that education and learning are the best gifts one can receive and give. You need to recognize this gift and demonstrate that you value it. IIM-A has armed you with a fine degree and most importantly valuable learning. Education builds not just the capacity to earn, but the capacity to remain relevant in an ever changing world. That we value the education and learning we have received, can be demonstrated by being mindful of our responsibility to all the people whose lives we touch through our action, or even inaction, and to the institutions, that we connect with. Above all of these, our economy and our country, must be on your radar. It is a responsibility that you must recognize early on in your careers.\n I say this because at some level, in the future, the broader success of our economy and our country does depend on how you, and your peers, chart your careers, in the companies that you join, the startups that you create, the institutions that you will one day lead.\n Today, India is on the cusp of leapfrogging into a digital economy and emergent trends will be about artificial intelligence, augmented reality, smart cities, humanoid robotics, digital therapeutics and sports innovation. These, and more, will all shape the course of your careers, and of the world in the future.\n It is truly a whole new world. Disruption is the ticket to thinking big, which, in turn, is the first step to achieving big. Disruption is no longer what it used to be - an occasional phenomenon, somewhat predictable, short-lived and easily recovered from. Disruption itself seems disrupted with much more qualitative force and impact than ever before. Disruption can be both a propeller and a derailer of an organization's journey. And, Disruption is as much an internal concern today as an external force.\n In a corporate setting, in my experience, internal disruptive challenges are equally critical. For example\nAn ethical slip by the leader that results in a huge regulatory penalty\nA disgruntled employee masquerading as a whistle blower\nOr, insiders colluding with outsiders to defraud companies\nOn the flipside of massive disruption is the fact that the universe of knowledge is yours like never before too - all at the click of a finger.",
      "Right": "This volley of information, leads to \"divergence\", which is the other big theme of our times, after \"disruption\". Divergences caused by an information overload that are evident in our society. Such as, the dichotomy of the traditional and modern, urban and rural, the past and the future, old and new, all co-existing side by side in an already pluralistic society. This is what you will have to address, tackle and navigate - with its accompanying complexities.\n When you thrive in this unequal world, acknowledge that the knowledge and learning that has enriched you, is not just for you alone. It is bestowed upon you to extend your role as a custodian, of your family and of your country at large. To whom much is given, much is expected.\n You will also encounter what futurists call over-choice. When I was growing up, there were three cars that we could buy - the Fiat, the Maruti 800 and the Ambassador. Today, Maruti Suzuki alone offers you a dozen choices.\n So, what does all of this mean? Our society as we know is splintering into socio-economic subsets at a dramatic pace. It would be critical to understand how that evolution is happening. But remember that the common denominator remains the same at all times, which is, the people factor.\n Each company will be searching for a new advantage, in the form of products, technologies, management, locations, prices, among many other variables. \"\nWinston Churchill put it a little differently\nSuccess is not final and failure is not fatal\nIt is the courage to go on that counts\"\nEducation helps us to imbibe this lesson and I hope you are certainly taking this with you to the world at large. The spirit and the courage to be at it until you succeed. And, real success is always about keeping oneself engaged with the next challenge and the next solution and being able to find it or be invited to it along the career journey.\n Many of you will be working in companies. Many of you may want to start a venture on your own, or engage in research. I would say look at something that has a meaning, an assignment with a purpose. It is all about your passion. It is being true to yourself. It is about being authentic. It is about giving back and, of course, it is about your own dreams. Make them come true.",

We are already seeing this phenomenon and it is only the start."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome0": "",
      "Outcome1": "Some possible ways to rewrite the text using bullet points are:\n\n- We live in a whole new world of digitalization and disruption\n  - Disruption can be an opportunity or a threat, depending on how we respond\n  - Disruption can also come from within, such as ethical lapses, whistle blowers, or fraud\n- We have access to a vast universe of knowledge and information\n  - This can give us an edge over the competition, if we harness it well\n  - This can also create divergences and complexities in our society, which we need to understand and address",
      "Outcome2": "Today, we are witnessing the rapid transformation of our economy and society by the forces of digitalization and divergence. Digitalization is the process of using technology to create new value and opportunities in various sectors and domains. Divergence is the phenomenon of increasing differences and divisions among people, groups, and regions, due to factors such as information overload, polarization, and inequality. These two forces are reshaping the world in unprecedented ways.\n\nAccording to a report by McKinsey, digital technologies could contribute $550 billion to $1 trillion of economic impact per year in India by 2025. This would be driven by increased productivity, innovation, inclusion, and empowerment of individuals and businesses. Digitalization can also enable India to leapfrog traditional barriers and challenges in areas such as healthcare, education, agriculture, and financial services.\n\nHowever, digitalization also poses some risks and challenges for our society. It can create new forms of exclusion, disruption, cybercrime, and ethical dilemmas. It can also widen the gap between those who have access to digital resources and skills, and those who do not. According to a report by Oxfam India, the richest 1% of Indians own 58% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 50% own only 2%. Moreover, India ranks 129th out of 189 countries in the Human Development Index (HDI), which measures life expectancy, education, and income.\n\nDivergence is also evident in our society as we witness the coexistence of multiple realities and identities. We have a diverse population that speaks over 22 official languages and follows various religions and cultures. We have a young demographic that is aspirational and tech-savvy but also faces unemployment and underemployment. We have a vibrant democracy that allows for free expression but also suffers from corruption and violence.\n\nThese divergences create both opportunities and challenges for us as individuals and as a nation. They require us to understand different perspectives, respect diversity, collaborate across boundaries, but also stand up for our values.",
      "Outcome3": "As we face the challenges and opportunities of disruption, we also have access to unprecedented sources of information and knowledge. In today's world, information moves at light-speed, with the sharing of ideas, news, and messages in split seconds, across the length and breadth of the country, as fibre optics and Wi-Fi, light up the nation. Indeed, those who harness this power, this advantage, will move far ahead of the pack. Digitalization will surely disrupt many industries. We are already seeing this phenomenon and it is only the start. However, information alone is not enough to cope with the complexity and diversity of our society. We need to develop a deeper understanding of the people factor that drives our economy and our country.",
      "Outcome4": "Today, we live in a world where information is abundant and accessible, where ideas, news, and messages spread instantly, across the country and beyond. This is a powerful advantage for those who can leverage it. But it also creates divergences in our society, between the traditional and modern, urban and rural, past and future, old and new. These are the complexities you will have to face and navigate. Digitalization will also disrupt many industries. We are only seeing the beginning of this change.",
      "Outcome5": "Today, we have many things that can help us learn and do things faster and better. We can use computers, phones, tablets, and other devices to find information and talk to people. Sometimes, these things change very quickly and surprise us. They make some things easier, but also make some things harder. This is what we call disruption. It can be good or bad for us.\n\nWe also have many different kinds of people in our world. They live in different places, speak different languages, wear different clothes, eat different foods, and believe in different things. Sometimes they agree with each other, sometimes they don't. Sometimes they share with each other, sometimes they don't. This is what we call divergence. It can be good or bad for us too.",
      "Outcome6": "As we live in a rapidly changing world, we are constantly exposed to new information and technologies that challenge our existing ways of doing things. Information travels at the speed of light, enabling us to access ideas, news, and messages from anywhere and anytime. This also means that we have to cope with the constant pressure of innovation and competition, as digitalization disrupts many industries and creates new opportunities. We are witnessing the dawn of a new era, where disruption is not an occasional event, but a continuous reality. Disruption can be both a catalyst and a threat for an organization's growth and survival. And disruption is not only an external force, but also an internal challenge that requires constant vigilance and adaptation. For instance,\n- A leader's ethical lapse that leads to a severe regulatory penalty\n- A dissatisfied employee who acts as a whistle blower or a saboteur\n- Or, insiders who collude with outsiders to defraud the organization\nOn the other hand, the abundance of information also gives us unprecedented access to the vast universe of knowledge that can empower us to learn and grow. We can leverage this advantage to stay ahead of the curve and create value for ourselves and others.",

Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening.

For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.",
      "Passage": "Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study."

      "Outcome3": "Another reason why I prefer reading novels to watching movies is that reading a novel is more convenient.

For example, I have been reading a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read it in one day, so I usually read it on my way home from English class. On the other hand, watching a movie would be impossible for me because I can only sit in front of the TV for 15 minutes before I have to study.",
      "Outcome4": "Another reason is that novels are easier to read anytime. Movies take about an hour or more to watch, but people can pause and resume reading a novel whenever they have a chance, like on a bus or train. For instance, I have been reading a novel for a week, since I only read it on my way home from English class. But I cannot finish a movie in 15 minutes, which is all the time I have for TV.",
      "Outcome5": "Another reason is that reading a book is easy to do. Some books have many pages and you need a lot of time to finish them. But you can read your book anytime you want, like when you are on a bus or a train. For example, I have a book that I like very much. I cannot read it all in one day, so I read it when I go back home from school. But watching a movie is not easy to do. You need to sit and watch the whole movie at once. I cannot do that because I only have a little time to watch TV and then I have to do my homework.",
      "Outcome6": "Another reason why fiction books are better than movies is that reading a novel is more flexible and convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. However, they do not need to read them in one sitting. They can easily carry their novels with them and continue to read whenever they find some free time, such as in bus or trains, or during lunch breaks. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read it all at once, so I usually read a few chapters when I am coming home from English class. On the other hand, watching a movie requires more commitment and planning. I cannot watch a complete movie because I can only sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study. If I pause the movie and resume it later, I might lose the interest or forget some details of the plot.",

According to a survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), 67% of employers prefer to hire candidates who have relevant work experience (NACE, 2017). Therefore, part-time jobs provide students with an opportunity to apply what they learn in the classroom to real-world situations and enhance their skills and knowledge. This is especially important in the current context where many universities lack adequate facilities or resources to offer sufficient practical training. Consequently, students who work part time can gain an edge over their peers who only rely on theoretical education. Furthermore, having work experience on their resumes can give them a competitive advantage when they look for full-time jobs after graduation.",
      "Outcome3": "One of the main benefits of taking extra jobs is that students can acquire valuable practical experience. They can apply their theoretical knowledge to real situations and learn from them. This is especially important when universities do not provide enough opportunities for practical learning. Therefore, students who work part time have an edge over their peers who only focus on academic studies. Furthermore, having work experience as a student can give them a competitive advantage when they look for jobs after graduation.",
      "Outcome4": "Extra jobs can help students gain practical experience that complements their academic learning. This is especially important given the lack of adequate practice opportunities in universities. Thus, students with part time jobs have both theoretical and practical skills. They also have an edge over other graduates when they look for jobs.",
      "Outcome5": "Some students work while they go to school. This can help them learn new things that they do not learn in school. For example, they can learn how to make coffee, fix a car, or write a report. These things can help them when they finish school and look for a job. Also, working can help them feel good about themselves and be more independent. They can talk to different people at work and share their ideas. They can also think for themselves and solve problems on their own. These skills can help them do better in school too.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main advantages of having extra jobs while studying at university is that students can gain their practical experience in various fields. Part-time jobs provide them with valuable opportunities to apply what they are learning at their universities to real situations. This is especially important considering the present lack of adequate practical facilities and equipment in many universities. Therefore, students who get part time jobs can acquire not only theoretical knowledge but also practical skills that are relevant to their future careers. Furthermore, having some work experience in different sectors during their student years gives them a competitive edge when they look for jobs after their graduation.",

The MWCL-1 cell line was established by and obtained from Dr. Stephen Ansell (Mayo Clinic Rochester). The RPCI-WM1 cell line was developed in our lab. Drug resistant clones from the 3 aforementioned cell lines were established in our lab. All cell lines were negative for mycoplasma contamination as tested on 8/4/16. These cell lines have not been previously STR profiled but will be submitted to Genetica DNA Laboratories - a LabCorp brand\nImmunoblot analysis\nProtein analysis using western botting techniques were carried out according to methods previously utilized by us.(1) Total protein extracts were prepared using RIPA lysis buffer with 0.2% protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, MO). Following centrifugation, the supernatant was collected for western blot analyses, and the protein content was measured by BCA protein assay reagent. Blots were developed using chemiluminescence (Thermo Scientific, IL). Antibodies used are as follows:\nCD184/CXCR4, BioLegend, Cat.",
      "Right": "Animal experiments\nAll animal experiments were performed as previously described,(2) with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Mayo Clinic. Animals were monitored daily by animal care personnel. We calculated that with a sample size of 7 per group, 80% power at the 5% significance level to detect a difference in means of 1800 mm3 between the 2 groups could be achieved. For percentage change in IgM from baseline, with a sample size of 7 per group, we calculated 80% power at the 5% significance level to detect a difference in means of 450% between the 2 groups. Fourteen female NOD/SCID mice (6 - 8 weeks of age, purchased from Charles River) were subcutaneously implanted with 1x106 luciferase labeled RPCI-WM1 cells (Luc-RPCI-WM1), which were allowed to grow till a bioluminescent signal was observed by IVIS imaging (Day 20). On day 21, mice were randomized into 2 groups (n=7 each), with one group receiving vehicle (cremaphor+PEG+Tween) and the other receiving VLX1570 at 4.4mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection. The investigator was not blinded to the group allocation. Both groups were respectively treated with either vehicle or VLX1570 every alternate day for 22 days. Sizes of the tumors was measured every 3 - 4 days using direct caliper measurements, and volume of the tumors was calculated using the formula (width)2 x length/2. Bioluminescent tumor imaging was performed with the Xenogen (IVIS) imaging system on Days 0, 20, 30, 36 and 43 post-tumor implantation. Blood from mice was collected on the same days by submandibular venous puncture, with sera subsequently separated for quantification of human IgM levels' using ELISA. On Day 44, mice were sacrificed, and final tumor volume was measured in control and treatment arms. All images were obtained using a Canon D40 digital camera. No specific criteria for inclusion/exclusion were used as all mice formed tumors and were therefore included into the study.",

We then deparaffinized and rehydrated the slides using standard protocols. To block endogenous peroxidase activity, we incubated the slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 minutes. We then washed the slides in DAKO TBS solution and applied a protein block (DAKO - Serum Free) for 5 minutes to reduce nonspecific binding.

      "Left": "In June 1939 , several Locust class gunboats arrived on the Yangtze to take over operations from the existing Insect class vessels . Part of the crew of the Gnat transferred to HMS Grasshopper , including Judy . Following the British declaration of war on Germany in September that year , several of the river gunboats , Grasshopper included , were redeployed to the British base at Singapore . Judy was initially sea sick , but the crew ensured that she was properly exercised and by the time the ship arrived on station , she had recovered .\n Initially the stay at Singapore was peaceful , and Judy stayed with a customs official and his family for a week ashore . The ship was rarely deployed until January 1942 when it was deployed with other gunboats to provide covering bombardments along the coast of Malaya for retreating troops , and occasionally to carry out evacuations . The Battle of Singapore took place between 8 – 15 February . By 11 February , Grasshopper and its sister ship Dragonfly were the largest vessels left at Singapore . On 13 February , the vessels were ordered to evacuate personnel and leave Singapore . The ships left at 9pm that evening , and travelled together .",
      "Right": "The island they arrived on turned out to be uninhabited with little food and no apparent water . After a camp had been set up ashore , Petty Officer George White was sent back to the still floating Grasshopper to scavenge supplies . He boarded the vessel and descended below decks to search for any items that might be of use . Whilst there , he felt Judy in the darkness , trapped under a row of lockers . He constructed a raft out of materials on the Grasshopper and rowed the items , along with Judy , back to the island . The lack of water was becoming an issue , until Judy began to dig at a point on the waterline . It took a couple of minutes , but Judy managed to unearth a fresh-water spring and was credited with saving everyone 's lives .\n Five days after the Grasshopper was bombed , a <unk> arrived which took the survivors to Singkep . There they left their wounded , and Judy along with the other survivors travelled two days later on a Chinese junk to Sumatra where it was hoped that a British force remained which could take them to Sri Lanka . Upon arrival , they took the vessel up a series of rivers until they narrowed so much that the junk could not pass . They then embarked on a 200-mile cross-country trek across the island in an attempt to reach Padang . During the journey through the jungle , Judy was attacked by a crocodile and suffered a cut to her shoulder . After a journey of five weeks , they arrived at Padang - but missed the last evacuation ship by a day as the Japanese were due to arrive to take over the city at any moment . After the arrival of the Japanese , the survivors from the Grasshopper along with Judy , were taken into custody as prisoners of war .",
      "Passage": "The ships headed for Singkep Island in the Dutch East Indies , hoping that the island group it sat in could be used as a hiding place . As they approached , Judy indicated the approach of Japanese aircraft and the anti-aircraft gunners took up their positions in readiness . The Grasshopper was hit with a single bomb before the planes departed . Judy was below decks when the planes returned . The Dragonfly was hit by three bombs and sank quickly . The Grasshopper was hit by a further two bombs , and the order was given to abandon ship as a fire spread close to an ammunition compartment . Boats were lowered and the crew and evacuees were ferried just over a hundred yards to shore whilst the Japanese planes strafed the vessels . It was only when they were ashore that they realised Judy was not with them ."

      "Outcome1": "As Singapore fell to the Japanese in February 1942, Grasshopper and Dragonfly, two British gunboats, tried to escape with some evacuees. They were attacked by Japanese planes and forced to land on a deserted island, where Judy, the ship's dog, helped them find fresh water. They were later rescued by a friendly boat and taken to Singkep Island, then to Sumatra on a Chinese junk. They had to trek across the jungle for weeks, but they missed the last ship out of Padang and were captured by the Japanese.",
      "Outcome2": "They wanted to go to Singkep Island. It was in the Dutch East Indies. They thought they could hide there. Judy warned them of Japanese planes. The planes came and dropped bombs. The Grasshopper and the Dragonfly got hit. The Dragonfly sank fast. The Grasshopper had a fire and a bomb near some bullets. They left the ship and went to the shore on small boats. The Japanese planes shot at them. When they got to the shore, they saw that Judy was not with them.",
      "Outcome3": "As they neared Singkep Island in the Dutch East Indies , the gunboats hoped to find a safe haven among the archipelago . Judy sensed the danger in the air and barked a warning to the anti-aircraft gunners who manned their posts . The Grasshopper was struck by a single bomb that tore through its hull , but the planes flew away . Judy had taken shelter below decks when they came back for another round . The Dragonfly was hit by three bombs that blasted it apart and sent it to the bottom of the sea . The Grasshopper suffered two more hits that ignited a fire near an ammunition compartment . The captain ordered everyone to abandon ship and escape in the boats . The Japanese planes continued to fire at them as they rowed frantically to shore , barely a hundred yards away . Only then did they notice that Judy was missing .",
      "Outcome4": "They sailed for Singkep Island in the Dutch East Indies , a possible hiding place . Judy warned them of Japanese planes , which bombed both ships . The crew and evacuees escaped to the island , but Judy was left behind . Petty Officer George White rescued her from the Grasshopper and brought her to the island . There , Judy dug up a fresh-water spring and saved them from thirst . After five days , a <unk> picked them up and took them to Singkep . They left their wounded there and sailed on a Chinese junk to Sumatra , hoping to reach Sri Lanka . They went up rivers until they had to walk 200 miles across the jungle to Padang . Judy was injured by a crocodile on the way . They missed the last ship out of Padang by a day and were captured by the Japanese as prisoners of war .",
      "Outcome5": "The ships wanted to go to a safe place where the bad planes could not find them . But when they got close , Judy heard the bad planes coming and told the people on the ship . The bad planes dropped big booms that made holes in the ships . The people had to get off the ships and go to a small island nearby , but they forgot to take Judy with them . One man went back to the ship and found Judy stuck under some boxes . He made a floaty thing out of stuff on the ship and brought Judy to the island too . The island had no food or water for the people , but Judy dug in the sand and found water for them to drink . They were very happy that Judy helped them . After a few days , another ship came and took them to another place where there were more people like them . They wanted to go home , but they had to go through a big forest first . In the forest , a mean lizard bit Judy , but she was okay . They walked for a long time until they got to a big town , but they missed their ride home by one day because the bad people came and caught them . Then they had to stay with the bad people who were not nice to them.",
      "Outcome6": "As they neared Singkep Island in the Dutch East Indies , the crew of the Grasshopper and the Dragonfly hoped to find a safe haven among the archipelago . Judy , who had a keen sense of hearing , was the first to alert them to the danger of incoming Japanese planes . The gunners quickly manned their anti-aircraft weapons and prepared to defend themselves . The Grasshopper was hit by a single bomb that damaged its engine room , but it managed to stay afloat . The planes flew away , but soon returned for another attack . This time , they targeted the Dragonfly , which was struck by three bombs and sank rapidly . The Grasshopper received two more hits , one of which ignited a fire near the ammunition store . The captain ordered everyone to abandon ship and get to the nearby shore as fast as possible . The crew and the evacuees used the lifeboats and rafts to escape from the burning vessel , while the Japanese planes continued to fire at them . In the chaos , no one noticed that Judy was still on board .",

      "Outcome1": "However, I disagree with the view that the huge income gap between the wealthy athletes and the ordinary people is unfair. I believe that fairness means giving everyone equal opportunities to pursue their dreams and careers, not equal pay for everyone. Fairness is about having the same access to the same goal or achievement, not the same reward.",
      "Outcome2": "Is it fair to pay athletes so much more than ordinary people? Some might say no, but I disagree. As the famous basketball player Michael Jordan once said, \"Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.\" Athletes are not just lucky or privileged, they are hard-working and dedicated to their craft. They deserve to be rewarded for their achievements and their contributions to the society.",
      "Outcome3": "Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment. In fact, according to a study by the International Olympic Committee, only 6% of athletes who participated in the 2016 Rio Olympics earned more than $50,000 per year from their sport, while 31% earned less than $15,000. This shows that most athletes are not wealthy and have to overcome many challenges and sacrifices to reach their level of excellence.",
      "Outcome4": "However, I think fairness means everyone has equal chances to pursue their dreams and careers, not equal payments for everyone. The gap between rich athletes and normal people reflects their different goals and achievements.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people may think that it is not fair that some people who play sports get a lot of money, while other people who work hard do not get much money. But I think that everyone should have the same chance to do what they like and be good at it. Being fair does not mean that everyone gets the same amount of money, but that everyone can try to do their best.",
      "Outcome6": "However, some people might have a different view on this issue. They might think that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. They might wonder why some people can earn millions of dollars just by playing games, while others have to work hard for a living. However, in my opinion, this kind of thinking is not reasonable. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to pursue one's dreams and careers. As long as everyone has the same opportunity to access education, training, and resources, they can choose their own paths and strive for their own goals. The high salaries of athletes are not given by chance, but earned by their hard work, talent, and dedication. They are the rewards for their own achievements and also a motivation for them to keep improving themselves.",

This evening we have two speakers. To begin, I would like to welcome Dr. Curt Robie, the Associate Vice President of Capital Planning and Construction, to speak to you all about some of the projects underway here on campus.\n Dr. Curt Robie: Good evening everybody, it's always a pleasure to come down to Senate. I've been here many times in my career. I'm just going to update you on the major capital projects that are underway on campus, and if you have any questions I'll be happy to answer them.",
      "Right": "As soon as classes are done, we're going to start moving them into the new building because we have to renovate 20,000 square feet in Wilson before classes resume in September, so it's a very robust site over the Summer, there's going to be a lot of coordination with the faculty to get all of the equipment and everything moved, get them into their temporary offices and new offices, and get everything set before school starts.\n I think it's going to be an exciting building; it's nice to see some new science labs on the campus. We are starting to pick some of the finishes; I think the color scheme is going to look very nice throughout the building. There's going to be an area for students to sit outside of the main entrance in the new quad between Bates, Wilson, and the new science center. I think it's going to be very nice.\n We're also working on putting in an electric charging station for electric cars on campus. We did have a couple of calls from faculty over the Summer wanting to know if we had an electric charging station. We were awarded one by the state, which means that the University isn't going to have to pay much for it to be installed, and they are very expensive, but they are going to be located in the commuter lot. That will be open to the general public as well as all the folks on campus.\n We're going to start to put some sustainable resources on the campus as well. Horace Mann Center; we started work, and you can't see a lot right now because right now we are just repairing cracks and retaining walls, but we started a $1,200,000 dollar project to renovate the main entrances to both sides of the building. We're going to be putting in new handicap ramps and getting rid of all those concrete partitions that are falling off of the backside of the building, we're going to spruce up the stairwell going down to CJ, and also redo the front entrance as well. That project has begun, it's going to go through until winter stops construction, and then it will pick up again in the spring. There is going to be some inconvenience because we're going to be changing the way that folks enter and go down to the garden level of the building.",

      "Right": "Despite the fact that rhetorical and persuasion are well rooted in communication theories (Golob and Podnar 2014; Davison 2014) and CSR communication becomes a fundamental to organization's experience, the way CSR communication produce a rhetorical vision, by constructing collective meaning of CSR, employ persuasion strategies in the text and so attempt maintaining legitimacy is not well studied is social accounting literature.\n To fill the gap this paper aims to explore the nature of rhetoric and rhetorical strategies that implicit in sustainability reporting produced by global corporation mostly drawing on communication theory perspective. We explore the way top 24 global corporations listed in Fortune 500 create rhetoric visions, persuade audiences (e.g. stakeholders) through textual persuasive linguistic style (e.g. ethos, pathos, Lagos) and use rhetorical strategies to legitimate their position. Rhetoric offers a useful framework for this study. Billig (1987) argues that rhetoric is an essential means to understand issues and make it understandable (Alvesson, 1993). By studying the rhetorical strategies that managers use in sustainability report, it adds to the understanding of how managers create different rhetorical vision and persuade stakeholders regards to their CSR. In addition, Brennan and Merkl-Davies (2014) mentioned 'Rhetoric serves to resolve both overt and covert conflicts between two parties and to avoid conflict in the first place' (p. 607). They added that 'Rhetorical approaches emphasises on the strategic or political nature of corporate narrative reporting and communication' (p. 607). In this study, we use rhetoric more than the strategies of persuasion, by taking the wider view that it is a means of human understanding and a process for constructing social reality (Putnam 2004; Watson 1995). Managers are considered to be 'rhetors' that produce and assign meaning in their language use (Billig 1987). This means that what managers communicate and how they attempt to persuade and for what purposes. Such an exploration is underpinned by multiple-theory perspective. We so have drawn upon Symbolic Convergence Theory (hereafter, SCT), Aristotle's (1991) explanation of persuasion and Suchman (1995) explanations of three types of legitimacy strategies-pragmatic, moral, and cognitive.\n SCT is a general communication theory developed by Bormann (1972) that explains the communicative force of fantasy effecting human action (Shields 2000).",
      "Passage": "The purpose of this paper is to investigate the nature of rhetoric and rhetorical strategies that implicit in the standalone sustainability reporting of the top 24 companies of the Fortune 500 Global. Ihlen et al (2011) argued that communication theory explanation of CSR is important from social constructionist and pragmatic perspectives in order to understand how the meaning of CSR is socially constructed, shared, implemented in organizations in one hand, and how CSR communication creates rhetorical vision and persuade others to retain self-interest of business. Indeed, rhetorical vision and persuasion are considered important mechanisms for constructing and reconstructing social facts (Finnemore 1996; Payne 2001). More broadly, persuasion is 'the process by which agent action becomes social structure, ideas become norms, and the subjective becomes the intersubjective' (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; Klotz 1999). Scholars like Cox (2010) in communication theory field also argue that environmental communication has two basic functions: first a \"pragmatic function in which we educate, alert, mobilize, and persuade others\" and second, a \"constitutive imaging and imagining the future function, in which language and other symbols themselves help to shape our perceptions about reality and the nature of environmental problems\" (p. 36). Taking communication perspective we so argue that CSR communication is an arena where social standards and expectations for corporate social responsibility are constantly articulated, persuaded negotiated and developed. Therefore, sustainability reporting are decidedly persuasive. Because, if corporate cannot persuade their constituencies to read their reporting and respond to them appropriately (i.e. whether working faithfully for the corporation, or believing it is a contributing member of a community or society), then the efforts of communicators (i.e. corporates) have been wasted (Stallworth 2008)."

      "Outcome1": "Our paper examines how the top 24 companies of the Fortune 500 Global use rhetoric and rhetorical strategies in their standalone sustainability reporting. We adopt a communication theory perspective, following Ihlen et al (2011), who argued that CSR communication is a social constructionist and pragmatic process that shapes and reflects the meaning, implementation, and vision of CSR in organizations and society. Rhetoric and persuasion are key mechanisms for creating and changing social facts, norms, and intersubjectivity (Finnemore 1996; Payne 2001; Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; Klotz 1999). Cox (2010) also suggested that environmental communication has two functions: to educate, alert, mobilize, and persuade others; and to construct our perceptions of reality and environmental problems through language and symbols. Therefore, we contend that sustainability reporting is a persuasive act that aims to influence the responses of various constituencies (e.g. employees, communities, investors) to the corporation's social and environmental performance (Stallworth 2008).",
      "Outcome2": "One of the main objectives of this paper is to examine the characteristics and techniques of rhetoric and persuasion that are embedded in the standalone sustainability reports of the top 24 companies of the Fortune 500 Global. As Ihlen et al (2011) argued, a communication theory perspective on CSR is relevant from both social constructionist and pragmatic viewpoints, since it helps to understand how CSR is socially constructed, shared, and implemented by organizations, as well as how CSR communication creates a rhetorical vision and persuades others to support the business's self-interest. Indeed, rhetorical vision and persuasion are regarded as important mechanisms for constructing and reconstructing social facts (Finnemore 1996; Payne 2001). More broadly, persuasion is 'the process by which agent action becomes social structure, ideas become norms, and the subjective becomes the intersubjective' (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; Klotz 1999).

Because if corporates cannot persuade their constituencies to read their reports and respond to them appropriately (i.e. whether working faithfully for the corporation or believing it is a contributing member of a community or society), then the efforts of communicators (i.e. corporates) have been wasted (Stallworth 2008).",
      "Outcome3": "Our paper adopts a rhetorical perspective to examine the sustainability reporting of the top 24 companies of the Fortune 500 Global. We draw on communication theory to understand how these companies use language and symbols to construct and communicate their CSR vision, values, and actions. We also explore how they employ different modes of persuasion to influence their stakeholders' attitudes and behaviors towards their CSR performance and legitimacy. To do so, we use a mixed-methods approach that combines qualitative and quantitative analysis of the textual data. We first apply Symbolic Convergence Theory (SCT) to identify the common themes and fantasies that emerge from the sustainability reports, which reflect the shared meaning and identity of the companies. SCT is a communication theory that explains how groups create a collective consciousness through symbolic interaction (Bormann 1972). We then use Aristotle's (1991) framework of persuasion to analyze how the companies use ethos, pathos, and logos appeals to convince their audiences of their CSR credibility, emotions, and logic. Aristotle (1991) is a classical rhetorician who proposed that effective persuasion requires appealing to these three elements. Finally, we use Suchman's (1995) typology of legitimacy strategies to examine how the companies justify their CSR claims and actions in relation to their stakeholders' expectations and norms. Suchman (1995) defines legitimacy as 'a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions' (p. 574). He distinguishes between three types of legitimacy strategies: pragmatic, moral, and cognitive.",
      "Outcome4": "Our paper examines how the top 24 companies of the Fortune 500 Global use rhetoric and rhetorical strategies in their standalone sustainability reporting. We draw on communication theory to understand how CSR communication constructs social reality, creates rhetorical vision, and persuades audiences. We argue that sustainability reporting is a persuasive form of communication that aims to maintain corporate legitimacy. We use Symbolic Convergence Theory, Aristotle's theory of persuasion, and Suchman's typology of legitimacy strategies as our analytical frameworks.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people work in big companies that make a lot of money. They want to tell other people that they are good and care about the world. They write stories about what they do to help people, animals, and the earth. We want to know how they write these stories and why they write them. We want to see if they use words that make us feel something or believe something. We want to see if they use words that make us think they are smart or nice or honest. We also want to see if they use words that make us agree with them or trust them. Sometimes, these words can help them solve problems or avoid problems with other people. We use some big ideas from people who study how we talk and write to help us understand these stories better.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main objectives of this paper is to examine the nature and characteristics of rhetoric and rhetorical strategies that are embedded in the standalone sustainability reporting of the top 24 companies of the Fortune 500 Global. We draw on communication theory to understand how these companies use rhetoric to construct and communicate their CSR practices and identities. Ihlen et al (2011) argued that communication theory provides a useful lens to explain CSR from social constructionist and pragmatic perspectives, as it helps to reveal how the meaning of CSR is socially created, shared, implemented in organizations on one hand, and how CSR communication generates rhetorical vision and persuades others to maintain self-interest of business on the other hand. Indeed, rhetorical vision and persuasion are considered important mechanisms for constructing and reconstructing social facts (Finnemore 1996; Payne 2001). In a broader sense, persuasion is 'the process by which agent action becomes social structure, ideas become norms, and the subjective becomes the intersubjective' (Finnemore and Sikkink 1998; Klotz 1999). Scholars like Cox (2010) in communication theory field also argue that environmental communication has two basic functions: first a \"pragmatic function in which we educate, alert, mobilize, and persuade others\" and second, a \"constitutive imaging and imagining the future function, in which language and other symbols themselves help to shape our perceptions about reality and the nature of environmental problems\" (p. 36). Based on this communication perspective, we contend that CSR communication is an arena where social standards and expectations for corporate social responsibility are constantly articulated, persuaded negotiated and developed. Therefore, sustainability reporting are decidedly persuasive. Because, if corporate cannot persuade their constituencies to read their reporting and respond to them appropriately (i.e. whether working faithfully for the corporation, or believing it is a contributing member of a community or society), then the efforts of communicators (i.e. corporates) have been wasted (Stallworth 2008).",

Similarly, the top 10 highest-paid singers in 2019 made $645.5 million, while the top 10 highest-paid doctors in 2020 made $313 million.

They say that singers and athletes only make people happy and have fun, but they do not make the world a better place. There are other people who work very hard to help the world, like scientists, doctors, and policemen. They make things that we use every day, they heal people who are sick or hurt, and they protect us from bad people. These people are more important than singers and athletes, but they get less money. That is not fair.",

Their main role is to provide entertainment and pleasure for the audience, which is certainly important but not essential.

      "Left": "McLean made 14 saves in his Canucks debut , recording an 8 – 2 win over the St. Louis Blues in the season opener on October 8 , 1987 . He notched his first NHL career shutout later that season on February 17 , 1988 , making 27 saves in a 5 – 0 win against the Pittsburgh Penguins . McLean split playing time with long-time Canucks starter Richard Brodeur in his first season in Vancouver , playing in 41 games with an 11-27-4 record , 3.71 GAA and .875 save percentage . He won his first of three Molson Cups with the Canucks at the end of the season , having earned the most three stars selections on the team .\n McLean emerged the following season in 1988 – 89 with a winning 20-17-3 record , 3.08 GAA and .891 save percentage . Early in the season , he returned to New Jersey in a game against the Devils and recorded a shutout against his former team in a 4 – 0 Canucks win on October 20 , 1988 . He went on to receive his first Vezina Trophy nomination as the league 's best goaltender and finished third in voting , losing to Patrick Roy of the Montreal Canadiens . In 1989 – 90 , McLean appeared in his first NHL All-Star Game in Pittsburgh and was the top goaltender at the Skills Competition by allowing the fewest goals against for the Breakaway Relay and Rapid Fire events . He led the league in games and minutes played with 63 and 3,738 , respectively . McLean also set Canucks records with 1,797 shots against and 1,581 saves ( both marks have since been surpassed ) . <unk> the Canucks to 21 wins , 33 losses and 10 ties , he won his first Cyclone Taylor Trophy as Canucks MVP and second Molson Cup .\n Early in the 1990 – 91 season , McLean re-signed with the Canucks to a one-year contract with a second year option on October 16 , 1990 . He was set to make $ 145,000 prior to re-organizing his contract for the season . McLean struggled in his fourth year with the Canucks , however , recording a career-worst 3.99 GAA with a 10-22-3 record in 41 games .",
      "Right": "McLean appeared in 54 games in 1992 – 93 , posting a 28-21-3 record . He recorded three shutouts , which included back-to-back <unk> in January 1993 . Playing against the Los Angeles Kings in the second round of the 1993 playoffs , McLean recorded his 15th playoff win in a 7 – 2 Game 4 victory , establishing himself as the winningest playoff goaltender in Canucks history . The Canucks were , however , eliminated in six games by Los Angeles , the eventual Western Conference champions .\n Towards the end of the 1993 – 94 season , McLean became a part of hockey history in a game against the Los Angeles Kings on March 23 , 1994 , by allowing Wayne Gretzky 's 802nd career NHL goal . The goal broke Gordie Howe 's record of 801 , making Gretzky the all-time leading goal-scorer in NHL history . Despite allowing the historic goal , the Canucks won the game 6 – 3 . McLean finished the season with a losing 23 – 26 – 3 record , as the Canucks finished with the seventh seed in the Western Conference .\n McLean 's peak with the Canucks came during the subsequent 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs , when he backstopped them to the seventh game of the Stanley Cup Finals . Facing the Calgary Flames in the opening round , he made one of the most memorable plays in Canucks and NHL playoff history – a series saving stop on Flames forward Robert Reichel during the first overtime of the seventh game . Reichel had one-timed a pass from Theoren Fleury on a 3-on-1 when McLean threw out both his pads to make the stop and preserve the series . With McLean out of position and Reichel having had an open net to shoot at , the red light even came on at the Olympic Saddledome to signal a goal . The following overtime , Bure scored to eliminate the Flames and advance the Canucks to the second round .\n Vancouver defeated the Dallas Stars the following round to advance to the semi-finals against the Toronto Maple Leafs . McLean posted back-to-back shutouts against the Leafs in the third and fourth games to tie the NHL playoff record of four shutouts in a single year ( the New York Rangers ' Mike Richter also recorded four that year ; they became the seventh and eighth goaltenders to tie the record .",
      "Passage": "McLean bounced back the following season in 1991 – 92 , starting the season with five consecutive wins to be named league player of the week for October 3 to 13 , 1991 .

Another season highlight for McLean occurred on December 4 , when he stopped all 50 shots in a game against the Montreal Canadiens to earn his third shutout of the season in a 3 – 0 win ; the performance garnered a standing ovation from Canadiens fans at the Montreal Forum . McLean went on to lead the league with five shutouts ( tied with the Chicago Blackhawks ' Ed Belfour , the Canadiens ' Patrick Roy and the Winnipeg Jets ' Bob Essensa ) and 38 wins in 65 games ( tied with the Red Wings ' Tim <unk> ) , as Vancouver won their first Smythe Division title since 1975 .

He earned his second Vezina Trophy nomination , finishing second in voting as Roy won the award once more . He recorded personal bests with a 2.74 GAA and 38 wins , the latter of which set a Canucks single-season goaltending record .

It contains authorities to gather information on code compliance (what is currently occurring) for plan review (what will occur in the future) but lacks the explicit authority to look at what happened in the past (which is the primary focus of a foodborne illness investigation).",

Both documents include the need for investigating foodborne illness outbreaks.\n Conducting investigations into how people became sick is an integral part of a food safety program. By understanding the system failures that resulted in a foodborne outbreak, practices can be changed to prevent the failure from happening in the future. Because of the investigation's importance, FDA includes this subject matter in VNRFPS standard 2 under the epidemiology construct and IFPTI includes this as a foundational element for the basic competency level. Additionally, the important nature of this work has developed additional advanced courses (e.g., FDA ER324 Epi-Ready for Response Teams, and CDC's Environmental Assessment Training Series).\n We recommend that a letter be sent to the FDA requesting that Chapter 8 of the most current published version of the Food Code be amended to include:\nThe REGULATORY AUTHORITY shall be provided access to all facilities, EQUIPMENT, FOOD, personnel, and existing records when needed during a foodborne illness investigation.\n It is the policy of the Conference for Food Protection to not accept Issues that would endorse a brand name or a commercial proprietary process.",

We want the Food Code to say that they have to help us when we ask them. That way, we can stop more people from getting sick.",

However, without an explicit authority in the Food Code, some jurisdictions may face legal or practical challenges in accessing information that is critical for identifying and controlling outbreaks.

Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.",

      "Outcome2": "Therefore, I am convinced that requiring students to take standardized tests is a beneficial policy, because it enables teachers to assess the learning outcomes of different students. By doing so, teachers can identify the students who need more support and guidance, and they can also distribute their time fairly among all students. I agree with those who argue that standardized tests are necessary rather than those who oppose them, because I think that teachers should have a clear understanding of each student's level.",
      "Outcome3": "Nonetheless, I acknowledge that standardized tests are not flawless and may have some drawbacks for students. For instance, some students may feel anxious or stressed when taking these tests, which could affect their performance and self-esteem. Moreover, standardized tests may not capture the full range of skills and abilities that students have, such as creativity, critical thinking, or collaboration. Therefore, I do not think that standardized tests should be the only measure of student achievement or learning. I still support the idea that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because they provide a useful feedback for teachers and students to improve their teaching and learning.",
      "Outcome4": "My view is that standardized tests are necessary, because they allow teachers to compare students' knowledge and help those who struggle. I agree with the proponents of this option, who argue that it leads to fairer and more effective teaching.",
      "Outcome5": "Another reason why I like tests is that they help teachers see who needs more help. Sometimes, some kids in the class don't understand things very well, but the teacher doesn't know. But if the teacher gives everyone a test, he can see who did well and who did not. Then he can spend more time with the kids who need more help. I think this is fair and nice for everyone.",
      "Outcome6": "Another reason why I support the idea that schools should require students to take standardized tests is that they can help teachers to evaluate and improve their teaching methods. By comparing the results of different students, teachers can identify the strengths and weaknesses of their curriculum and instruction. They can also provide more individualized attention and feedback to the students who need extra help or challenge. Therefore, I think that standardized tests are beneficial for both teachers and students, and I agree with those who advocate for them over those who oppose them.",

      "Left": "The history of numerical weather prediction began in the 1920s through the efforts of Lewis Fry Richardson , who used procedures originally developed by Vilhelm Bjerknes to produce by hand a six-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe , taking at least six weeks to do so . It was not until the advent of the computer and computer simulations that computation time was reduced to less than the forecast period itself . The ENIAC was used to create the first weather forecasts via computer in 1950 , based on a highly simplified approximation to the atmospheric governing equations . In 1954 , Carl-Gustav Rossby 's group at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute used the same model to produce the first operational forecast ( i.e. , a routine prediction for practical use ) . Operational numerical weather prediction in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit ( JNWPU ) , a joint project by the U.S. Air Force , Navy and Weather Bureau . In 1956 , Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere ; this became the first successful climate model . Following Phillips ' work , several groups began working to create general circulation models . The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory .",
      "Right": "The output of forecast models based on atmospheric dynamics is unable to resolve some details of the weather near the Earth 's surface . As such , a statistical relationship between the output of a numerical weather model and the ensuing conditions at the ground was developed in the 1970s and 1980s , known as model output statistics ( MOS ) . Starting in the 1990s , model ensemble forecasts have been used to help define the forecast uncertainty and to extend the window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into the future than otherwise possible .",
      "Passage": "As computers have become more powerful , the size of the initial data sets has increased and newer atmospheric models have been developed to take advantage of the added available computing power . These newer models include more physical processes in the simplifications of the equations of motion in numerical simulations of the atmosphere . In 1966 , West Germany and the United States began producing operational forecasts based on primitive-equation models , followed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and Australia in 1977 . The development of limited area ( regional ) models facilitated advances in forecasting the tracks of tropical cyclones as well as air quality in the 1970s and 1980s . By the early 1980s models began to include the interactions of soil and vegetation with the atmosphere , which led to more realistic forecasts ."

      "Outcome1": "Computers have become more powerful over time. This has allowed for larger initial data sets and newer atmospheric models. These models include more physical processes in the numerical simulations of the atmosphere. In 1966, West Germany and the United States started to use primitive-equation models for operational forecasts. The United Kingdom and Australia followed them in 1972 and 1977 respectively. Limited area models were developed in the 1970s and 1980s. They improved the forecasting of tropical cyclones and air quality. In the early 1980s, models began to account for the interactions of soil and vegetation with the atmosphere. This made the forecasts more realistic.",
      "Outcome2": "Computers have become faster and better over time , so they can use more data and more realistic rules to make weather predictions . The first computer models in the 1950s used very simple rules , but later models added more details about how the air moves and changes . In 1966 , Germany and the U.S. started to use more advanced models for their weather forecasts , and other countries followed them later . The new models also helped to predict how storms and air quality would change in smaller areas . In the early 1980s , the models began to include how the land and plants affect the weather , which made the forecasts more accurate .",
      "Outcome3": "Some of the models and their features that have been developed since the 1960s are:\n\n- Primitive-equation models, which use a more accurate approximation of the atmospheric governing equations and were first used operationally by West Germany and the United States in 1966\n- Limited area models, which focus on a specific region of the globe and can better simulate tropical cyclones and air quality, introduced in the 1970s and 1980s\n- Soil-vegetation-atmosphere models, which incorporate the interactions of land surfaces and plants with the atmospheric processes, leading to more realistic forecasts, developed in the early 1980s",
      "Outcome4": "Computers became more powerful and data sets grew larger , allowing more complex atmospheric models to emerge . Primitive-equation models became operational in several countries in the 1960s and 1970s . Regional models improved forecasts of tropical cyclones and air quality . Soil and vegetation interactions were added to models in the early 1980s for more realism .",
      "Outcome5": "Computers are machines that can do math very fast . Some people use computers to help them guess what the weather will be like later . They use a special way of doing math that tells them how the air moves and changes . But sometimes the computers cannot tell exactly what will happen near the ground , where we live . So some other people use a different way of doing math that helps them make better guesses based on what the computers say . They also use many computers together to make different guesses and see which ones are more likely to be right . This way , they can tell us what the weather will be like for a longer time .",
      "Outcome6": "As the computational power of computers increased over time , the numerical weather models were able to incorporate more data from observations and represent more physical processes in the simulations . The equations of motion that govern the atmosphere were simplified to make them numerically solvable , but still retained the essential features of the atmospheric dynamics . In 1966 , West Germany and the United States became the first countries to produce operational forecasts based on models that solved these primitive equations , followed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and Australia in 1977 . The primitive-equation models were able to capture the large-scale features of the atmosphere , but had limitations in resolving smaller-scale phenomena such as tropical cyclones and air quality . To overcome these limitations , limited area models were developed that focused on a specific region of interest with higher resolution and more detailed physics . These regional models improved the forecasting skill for tropical cyclone tracks and air pollution events in the 1970s and 1980s . Another advancement in numerical weather prediction was the inclusion of land surface processes , such as soil moisture and vegetation , that influenced the exchange of energy and moisture between the ground and the atmosphere . This led to more realistic forecasts of surface temperature and precipitation by accounting for the effects of soil memory and vegetation feedbacks in the early 1980s .",

      "Left": "By 1943 the Luftwaffe 's strength on the Eastern Front had started to weaken , especially after Stalingrad . The Luftwaffe forces in the east were further depleted with squadrons being shifted back to Germany to defend against the increasing Allied bombing campaign . By the end of June , only 38.7 percent of the Luftwaffe 's total aircraft remained in the east . In 1943 the Luftwaffe could still achieve local air superiority by concentrating its forces . The majority of German aircraft left available on the Eastern Front were slated for Citadel . The goal of the Luftwaffe remained unchanged . The priority of the German air fleet ( s ) was to gain air superiority , then to isolate the battlefield from enemy reinforcements , and finally , once the critical point had been reached in the land battle , to render close air support .\n The changing strengths between the two opponents prompted the Luftwaffe to make operational changes for the battle . Previous offensive campaigns had been initiated with Luftwaffe raids against opposing airfields to achieve air superiority . By this point in the war Red Army equipment reserves were extensive and the Luftwaffe commanders realised that aircraft could be easily replaced , making such raids futile . Therefore , this mission was abandoned . In addition , previous campaigns had made use of medium bombers flying well behind the frontline to block the arrival of reinforcements . This mission , however , was rarely attempted during Citadel .",
      "Right": "For Citadel , the Luftwaffe confined its operations to the direct support of the forces on the ground . In this mission the Luftwaffe continued to make use of the Junkers Ju 87 \" Stuka \" dive-bombers . A new development to this aircraft was the \" Bordkanone \" 3,7 cm calibre cannon , one of which could be slung under each wing of the Stuka in a gun pod . Half of the Stuka groups assigned to support Citadel were equipped with these <unk> ( literally \" cannon-bird \" ) <unk> aircraft . The air groups were also strengthened by the recent arrival of the Henschel Hs 129 , with its 30 mm MK 103 cannon , and the ground attack ( \" <unk> \" ) version of the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 .\n In the months preceding the battle , Luftflotte 6 supporting Army Group Center noted a marked increase in the strength of the opposing VVS formations . The VVS formations encountered displayed better training , and were flying improved equipment with greater aggressiveness and skill than the Luftwaffe had seen earlier . The introduction of the Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-5 fighters gave the Soviet pilots near parity with the Luftwaffe in terms of equipment . Furthermore , large numbers of ground-attack aircraft , such as the Ilyushin Il-2 \" Shturmovik \" and the Pe-2 , had become available as well . The Soviet Air Force also fielded large quantities of aircraft supplied via lend-lease . Huge stockpiles of supplies and ample reserves of replacement aircraft meant the Red Army and VVS formations would be able to conduct an extended campaign without slackening in the intensity of their effort .",
      "Passage": "The Luftwaffe command understood that their support would be crucial for the success of Operation Citadel , but problems with supply shortfalls hampered their preparations . Partisan activity , particularly behind Army Group Center , slowed the rate of re-supply and cut short the Luftwaffe 's ability to build up essential stockpiles of petrol , oil , lubricants , engines , munitions , and , unlike Red Army units there were no reserves of aircraft that could be used to replace damaged aircraft over the course of the operation . Fuel was the most significant limiting factor . To help build up supplies for the support of Citadel , the Luftwaffe greatly curtailed its operations during the last week of June . Despite this conservation of resources , the Luftwaffe did not have the resources to sustain an intensive air effort for more than a few days after the operation began ."

Partisan activity, especially behind Army Group Center, disrupted the re-supply and prevented the Luftwaffe from building up essential stockpiles of petrol, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and aircraft reserves. Unlike Red Army units, they had no spare aircraft to replace damaged ones during the operation. Fuel was the most critical resource they lacked. They tried to conserve resources by reducing their operations in the last week of June. However, they could only sustain an intensive air effort for a few days after the operation started.",
      "Outcome2": "Unlike previous offensive campaigns, the Luftwaffe faced severe supply shortages that hindered its preparations for Citadel. Partisan attacks behind Army Group Center disrupted the delivery of vital supplies, such as fuel, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and spare aircraft. The Luftwaffe could not afford to waste its resources on raids against enemy airfields or strategic bombing missions, as it had done before. The Soviet air force had built up large reserves of planes and equipment that could easily replace any losses. Therefore, the Luftwaffe focused its efforts on providing direct support to the ground forces in the form of close air support and interdiction. To enhance its firepower against Soviet tanks and fortifications, the Luftwaffe deployed new weapons and aircraft, such as the 3.7 cm cannon pods for the Stuka dive-bombers, the Henschel Hs 129 with its 30 mm cannon, and the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 in its ground attack role.",
      "Outcome3": "The German air force knew that they had to help the ground troops if they wanted to win the battle, but they had trouble getting ready for it. Some fighters who opposed them in the woods made it hard for them to bring more supplies and equipment. They also did not have enough fuel to keep flying for a long time. To save fuel, they flew less often in the last week of June. But even then, they did not have enough resources to keep up their air attacks for more than a few days after the battle started.",
      "Outcome4": "Operation Citadel depended on the Luftwaffe's support, but it faced supply problems. Partisans disrupted the delivery of fuel, spare parts, and ammunition. The Luftwaffe reduced its activities before the attack to save resources, but it could only sustain a high level of air support for a short time.",
      "Outcome5": "Before the big battle, the German planes had to get ready. But they had a hard time getting what they needed. Some people who did not like them tried to stop their trucks and trains. They did not have enough gas or bullets or spare parts for their planes. They could only fly for a little while when the battle started. They also stopped doing some things that they used to do before other battles, because they did not work very well anymore.",
      "Outcome6": "Despite the recognition of the Luftwaffe command that their support would be vital for the outcome of Operation Citadel, they faced serious challenges in preparing for the battle. One of the main difficulties was the disruption of their supply lines by partisan activity, especially behind Army Group Center. The partisans sabotaged railways and roads, making it harder for the Luftwaffe to transport essential materials such as petrol, oil, lubricants, engines, munitions, and spare parts. Unlike the Red Army units, which had ample reserves of aircraft and equipment, the Luftwaffe had no such margin of safety and could not afford to lose many planes during the operation. Fuel was the most critical shortage that affected the Luftwaffe's operations. To conserve fuel for the support of Citadel, the Luftwaffe reduced its sorties during the last week of June. However, even with this measure, the Luftwaffe knew that it could not sustain a high level of air activity for more than a few days after the operation started.",

They claim that school curriculum is not relevant to the real world and that children can learn more practical skills by working.

According to a report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median weekly earnings of workers with a bachelor's degree were $1,248 in 2019, while those with only a high school diploma earned $746. Moreover, workers with higher levels of education had lower unemployment rates than those with less education. Therefore, staying in school can increase children's chances of finding a well-paid and stable job in the future. On the other hand, leaving school to find a job can have negative consequences for children's development. For instance, working may interfere with their academic performance, health and well-being. A study by the National Center for Education Statistics found that high school students who worked more than 15 hours per week had lower grades, higher dropout rates and more health problems than those who worked less or did not work at all.

The war ended less than a month after the Sharifian – British conquest of Damascus . In correspondences between the Sharifian leadership in Mecca and Henry McMahon , the British high commissioner in Cairo , the latter promised to support the establishment of a Sharifian kingdom in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire in return for launching a revolt against the Ottomans . However , the British and French governments made previous arrangements regarding the division of the Ottomans ' Arab provinces between themselves in the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement .\n To allay his fears regarding his throne in Syria , Faisal attended the January 1919 Paris Conference , where he was not recognized by the French government as the sovereign ruler of Syria ; Faisal called for Syrian sovereignty under his rule , but the European powers attending the conference called for European mandates to be established over the former Arab territories of the Ottoman Empire . In the US-led June 1919 King – Crane Commission , which published its conclusions in 1922 , the commission determined that the people of Syria overwhelmingly rejected French rule . Furthermore , Emir Faisal stated to the commission that \" French rule would mean certain death to Syrians as a distinguished people \" .",
      "Right": "On 8 March 1920 , the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Kingdom of Syria , with Faisal as king . This unilateral action was immediately rejected by the British and French . In the San Remo Conference , which was called by the Allied Powers in April 1920 , the allocation of mandates in the Arab territories was finalized , with France given a mandate over Syria . France 's allocation of Syria was , in turn , repudiated by Faisal and the Syrian National Congress . After months of instability and failure to make good on the promises Faisal had made to the French , General Gouraud gave an ultimatum to Faisal on 14 July 1920 demanding that he disband the Arab Army and submit to French authority by 20 July or face a French military invasion . On 18 July , Faisal and the entire cabinet , with the exception of War Minister Yusuf al- ' Azma , agreed to the ultimatum and issued disbandment orders for the Arab Army units at Anjar , the Beirut – Damascus road and the hills of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains overlooking the Beqaa Valley . Two days later , Faisal informed the French liaison in Damascus of his acceptance of the ultimatum , but for unclear reasons , Faisal 's notification did not reach Gouraud until 21 July . Sources suspicious of French intentions accused the French of intentionally delaying delivery of the notice to give Gouraud an official excuse for advancing on Damascus . However , there has been no evidence or indication of French sabotage . News of the disbandment and Faisal 's submission led to riots in Damascus on 20 July and their suppression by Emir Zeid , which led to around 200 deaths .

      "Outcome2": "French forces commanded by General Henri Gouraud landed in Beirut on 18 November 1919 , with the ultimate goal of bringing all of Syria under French control . Shortly thereafter , French forces deployed to the Beqaa Valley , a strategic region between Beirut and Damascus that was vital for the communication and supply of the Arab Army . Against King Faisal 's wishes , his delegate to General Gouraud , Nuri al-Said , agreed to the French deployment and the disbandment of Arab troops from al-Mu <unk> , near Zahle , a Christian town that had been hostile to Faisal 's rule . The agreement between al-Said and Gouraud was contrary to an earlier agreement Faisal had made with French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau , which held that French troops would not deploy in the Beqaa Valley until the League of Nations ruled on the matter . Faisal condemned al-Said and accused him of treachery . Following the Arab Army withdrawal from al-Mu <unk> , Christian militiamen from Zahle raided the town , prompting attacks from local Muslim militiamen , which forced several Christian families to flee to the coast . Amid these developments , armed groups of rebels and bandits emerged throughout the Beqaa Valley, challenging both Faisal's authority and French presence. When a French officer in Baalbek, a Shia Muslim stronghold, was assaulted by rebels opposed to the French occupation, Gouraud believed the Arab government was responsible for the act and demanded that it apologize, which it did not. In response, Gouraud violated his agreement with al-Said and occupied Baalbek, further undermining Faisal's credibility. The French deployment along the Syrian coast and the Beqaa Valley provoked unrest throughout Syria and sharpened political divisions between the political camp that called for confronting the French and the camp that sought compromise.",
      "Outcome3": "As the French forces commanded by General Henri Gouraud landed in Beirut on 18 November 1919 , they had the ultimate goal of bringing all of Syria under French control . Their arrival soon led to a series of clashes and agreements with the Arab authorities and local communities . One of these agreements was made by Faisal 's delegate to General Gouraud , Nuri al-Said , who consented to the French deployment in the Beqaa Valley and the disbandment of Arab troops from al-Mu <unk> , near Zahle . This agreement violated an earlier one that Faisal had made with French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau , which stipulated that no French troops would enter the Beqaa Valley until the League of Nations decided on the matter . Faisal denounced al-Said and accused him of treachery . The withdrawal of Arab troops from al-Mu <unk> triggered sectarian violence between Christian and Muslim militiamen in the area , as well as the emergence of armed groups of rebels and bandits throughout the Beqaa Valley . When a French officer in Baalbek was attacked by Shia Muslim rebels who opposed the French presence , Gouraud blamed the Arab government for instigating the incident and demanded an apology , which was not forthcoming . In retaliation , Gouraud broke his agreement with al-Said and occupied Baalbek . The French actions along the Syrian coast and the Beqaa Valley provoked unrest throughout Syria and deepened political divisions between those who wanted to confront the French and those who sought compromise .\n\nThe confrontation camp gained momentum when, on 8 March 1920 , the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Kingdom of Syria , with Faisal as king . This unilateral declaration was immediately rejected by both Britain and France . The following month , at the San Remo Conference convened by the Allied Powers , France was awarded a mandate over Syria . This decision was also repudiated by Faisal and the Syrian National Congress . After months of instability and failure to fulfill his promises to France , General Gouraud issued an ultimatum to Faisal on 14 July 1920 demanding that he disband his Arab Army and submit to French authority by 20 July or face a French military invasion . On 18 July , Faisal and his entire cabinet, except for War Minister Yusuf al- ' Azma, agreed to comply with this ultimatum. They issued orders for disbanding their army units at Anjar, on Beirut – Damascus road, and in Anti-Lebanon Mountains overlooking Beqaa Valley. However, due to some unclear reasons, Faisal 's notification did not reach Gouraud until 21 July. Some sources suspected that this delay was intentional on France's part, as it gave Gouraud an official pretext for advancing on Damascus. However, there is no evidence or indication of such sabotage. News of disbandment order and Faisal 's submission sparked riots in Damascus on 20 July. Emir Zeid, Faisal's brother, suppressed them violently, resulting in around 200 deaths. Al- ' Azma, who was adamantly opposed to surrendering, implored Faisal to give him and remnants of his army a chance to confront French.",
      "Outcome4": "France's General Gouraud landed troops in Beirut in November 1919 to take over Syria. He ignored an earlier deal with Faisal and moved into the Beqaa Valley, where he faced resistance from local rebels. Faisal's envoy Nuri al-Said agreed to let the French advance and disband the Arab Army, angering Faisal and many Syrians. The Syrian National Congress declared Faisal king of Syria in March 1920, but the Allies gave France a mandate over Syria in April. Gouraud threatened to invade Damascus unless Faisal surrendered by 20 July. Faisal agreed, but his message was delayed and did not reach Gouraud until 21 July. Meanwhile, Damascus erupted in riots and violence. War Minister Yusuf al- ' Azma urged Faisal to fight the French.",
      "Outcome5": "Some French soldiers came to a place called Beirut , which was near another place called Syria . The people in Syria were led by a king named Faisal , who wanted to be free from the old rulers , the Ottomans . But the French also wanted to rule over Syria and other places that used to belong to the Ottomans . Faisal sent one of his men to talk to the French leader , General Gouraud , and they made a deal that the French could stay in some parts of Syria for a while . But Faisal did not like this deal and he had another deal with someone else before . He also did not know that his man agreed to let the French go into more places in Syria than he wanted . Faisal was very angry with his man and said he was a traitor . Some people in Syria did not like the French either and they fought with them or stole from them . The French leader thought Faisal was behind all this trouble and he asked him to say sorry , but Faisal did not . So the French leader broke his deal with Faisal 's man and went into more places in Syria with his soldiers . This made many people in Syria unhappy and scared , and they did not agree on what to do about the French .",
      "Outcome6": "As part of their plan to extend their influence over Syria, French forces under the command of General Henri Gouraud landed in Beirut on 18 November 1919. Their ultimate goal was to bring the entire country under French control and enforce the mandate that was assigned to them by the Allied Powers. However, they faced resistance from King Faisal and his Arab government, who had declared Syria's independence after capturing Damascus from the Ottoman Empire. To avoid a direct confrontation with Faisal, Gouraud initially agreed to limit his troops' deployment to the coastal area and the Beqaa Valley, a wide region between Beirut and Damascus. He also negotiated with Faisal's representative, Nuri al-Said, who consented to the French presence in the valley and agreed to withdraw the Arab troops from al-Mu <unk>, a strategic town near Zahle. This agreement was in violation of an earlier promise that Faisal had received from French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, who had assured him that no French soldiers would enter the Beqaa Valley until the League of Nations decided on the fate of Syria. Faisal was outraged by al-Said's betrayal and accused him of treachery. He also denounced the French violation of Clemenceau's promise and demanded their withdrawal from the valley.\n\nThe French occupation of al-Mu <unk> sparked sectarian tensions between the Christian and Muslim inhabitants of Zahle, who had coexisted peacefully for centuries. The Christian militiamen of Zahle attacked al-Mu <unk> after the Arab troops left, provoking retaliation from local Muslim militiamen, who forced many Christian families to flee to the coast. The violence in Zahle spread throughout the Beqaa Valley, where armed groups of rebels and bandits emerged to challenge the French authority. One of these groups assaulted a French officer in Baalbek, a major town in the northern part of the valley, which was inhabited mostly by Shia Muslims who opposed the French presence. Gouraud blamed Faisal's government for instigating this attack and demanded an apology from them, which they refused to give. In response, Gouraud broke his agreement with al-Said and occupied Baalbek with his troops.\n\nThe French expansion along the Syrian coast and into the Beqaa Valley caused widespread unrest throughout Syria and deepened political divisions among its leaders. Some politicians advocated for a peaceful compromise with France, while others called for a military confrontation to defend Syria's sovereignty.",

She has often voiced her support for same-sex marriage , advocating all people have the right to fall in love . In 2008 , Jackson appeared in a public service announcement sponsored by the Logo television network and the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network ( GLSEN ) in response to the E.O. Green School shooting . The announcement discusses the murder of fifteen-year-old Lawrence \" Larry \" King and the safety of LGBT youth in public schools . Jackson states that \" none of us are safe , until all of us are safe \" . On April 26 , 2008 , fellow gay icon Ellen DeGeneres presented Jackson with the Vanguard Award at the 19th Annual GLAAD Media Awards at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles .\n We are delighted to honor Janet Jackson at the 19th Annual GLAAD Media Awards in Los Angeles as such a visible , welcoming and inclusive ally of the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) community .

I kept everything inside ... and it hurt me a lot. And I needed someone I could trust, an adult who I could tell my problems to. That's what these groups do. They have a phone number you can call anytime and talk to someone who cares about you.\" She also made a video to tell LGBT kids that things will get better for them.",
      "Outcome2": "As a longtime ally of the LGBT community, Jackson expressed her desire to raise awareness and compassion for transgender people through the documentary project. She said: \"I want to use my voice and platform to speak up for those who face discrimination and violence every day because of who they are. I believe that everyone deserves respect and dignity, and that love is stronger than hate.\" Jason, who has directed several films about transgender issues, shared his vision for the film as a groundbreaking exploration of gender diversity around the world. He said: \"This film will challenge the stereotypes and misconceptions that many people have about transgender people, and show them the beauty and courage of their lives. We hope that this film will inspire more acceptance and understanding of the transgender community, and celebrate their contributions to society.\"",
      "Outcome3": "On CNN, Jackson expressed her support for the It Gets Better Project and The Trevor Project, two initiatives that aim to prevent suicide and bullying among LGBT youth. She shared her own experience of feeling isolated and hopeless as a child, and encouraged young people to reach out for help. She also made an official video for the It Gets Better Project, which was released on World AIDS Day in 2010.",
      "Outcome4": "On CNN, Jackson told Larry King she supported the It Gets Better Project and The Trevor Project, which help LGBT youth facing crisis and suicide.

She also made an It Gets Better video, released on December 1, 2010.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people are mean to other people who are different from them. They might say bad things or hurt them. This is not nice and it can make those people feel very sad. Sometimes they feel so sad that they want to die. Jackson wants to help those people. She wants to tell them that they are not alone, and that things will get better. She also wants to tell the mean people to stop being mean, and to try to understand those who are different. She made a video where she says these things.",

She said: \"I was one of those kids who kept everything inside and didn't talk about my feelings or my problems. And that can really affect you negatively, and make you feel like there's no hope or no way out. That's why it's so important to find someone you can trust, an adult who can listen to you and help you cope. That's what the Trevor Project does. They have a 24-hour hotline where you can call and talk to someone who cares about you and understands what you're going through.\" She also recorded a video message for the It Gets Better Project, which was released on World AIDS Day, December 1, 2010.",

      "Left": "A possible way to restructure the document into new paragraphs based on semantic similarity is:\nDocument:\n This paper discusses the need to design for a circular economy. We aim to make scalable recommendations for future research and practice to support closed-loop innovation in the textile sector, and explore how the findings might be expanded upon to craft circular conversations to support emerging designers.\n textiles; craft; circular economy; waste; designers; creative and participatory methods\nHeightened awareness of the economic value being lost through waste coupled with a rise in resourcing risks have elevated business interest in the circular economy. While the term 'circular economy' is becoming appropriated on a global scale to address a wide range of issues regarding waste, there is little evidence available to demonstrate how this might be applied by small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and understood by Higher Education (HE). Rising resource risks and the growing recognition of the economic value being lost in waste have raised business interest in the circular economy. A recent study by McKinsey (2015) titled Growth within: A circular economy vision for a competitive Europe identified that resource productivity remains hugely under exploited as a source of wealth, competitiveness, and renewal. They argue that a circular economy, enabled by the technology revolution, would allow Europe to grow resource productivity by up to 3 percent annually. Concurring with the RSA's perspective, we propose that design-led approaches can play a key role to play addressing these challenges:\n And for these to be learned and ingrained, they must first be tested and actively encouraged.",
      "Right": "From this point we present two case studies derived from across the field of design research in order to extrapolate the ways in which creative and participatory design approaches can be used to stimulate productive dialogue around both the circular economy, and broader environmental issues. This allows us to identify six design principles for design researchers to consider when facilitating such conversations. We then reflect on the implications of these principles for future research around the circular economy and the role of the textile designer therein, and highlight the significance of design-led approaches in strengthening communication, promoting creative action, and embedding collaborative ways of working.\n Within the UK textile sector, there is increasing awareness of the requirement for new textile initiatives to be linked with the concept of the circular economy (Goldsworthy 2012; 2013), but there is a lack of practical knowledge and accessible evidence available to provide support in the textile sector. Moving forward knowledge exchange will be essential alongside innovative tools to mediate dialogue and support joined-up thinking to connect all stakeholders involved in the supply chain of fashion and textiles.\n According to Scottish Enterprise, the textile sector of the business community have highlighted there is a lack of resources for R&D and business model innovation (Scottish Enterprise 2013). While Scottish based fashion / textile SME's (small to medium enterprises) are currently adding value to previously discarded textile waste by applying their practical skills, knowledge and expertise to rework and reuse (Simonella 2016; Kent 2016; Taylor 2015). From a broader perspective fashion and textile designers have been adopting sustainable design principals and strategies, with a plethora of innovative examples emerging within the last decade, demonstrating new concepts such as; zero waste pattern cutting (Gwilt and Rissanen 2011; Rissanen and McQuillain 2015), design for disassembly (Van Balgooi 2015) and upcycling (Earley 2015; DeCastro 2015). Those working with post consumer textile waste highlight the scope of redesign is often influenced by the first lifecycle of the garment or textile. The circular economy posits a new position by arguing a case for closed loop innovation from the outset.\n To achieve a circular model we propose a more holistic approach, with circular design discussed at the front end of the innovation process.",
      "Passage": "This paper will explore the work in the area of Material Futures - undertaken by a research collective based at The Glasgow School of Art (GSA). Throughout this work the researchers seeks to raise awareness of the circular economy to support the Scottish textile sector. By identifying the most appropriate design-led approaches for crafting conversations that attend to addressing gaps in knowledge and practice, these seek to connect textile designers with other stakeholders across the supply chain. Through positing the research question 'which design principles are required to craft conversations around the circular economy?' We begin by discussing current debates within the textiles and craft industries and outline the challenges of articulating the applications of a circular economy."

      "Left": "Casting twins in a single role thus allows more time for the character to be filmed . Beginning at eight months old , the two played a single character , Patrick Kelly , on the ABC series Grace Under Fire .\n In 1999 , the boys appeared in their first major feature film , Big Daddy , in which they shared the role of a five-year-old boy named Julian who is adopted by Adam Sandler 's character , Sonny Koufax . Though the film received mixed reviews , the two were nominated for multiple awards for their role in the movie . However , they did not win any . The same year , the boys also had a minor role in the thriller The Astronaut 's Wife . The Sprouses have noted that after Big Daddy 's release , they entered a slow period in their careers and were not cast in any major roles for a time . During the early 2000s , the twins appeared in episodes of The Nightmare Room and That ' 70s Show , as well as in MADtv and portrayed roles in the feature films The Master of Disguise and Adam Sandler 's Eight Crazy Nights . Cole began appearing in episodes of the television show Friends , as Ross Geller 's son Ben in 2001 ; this role was not shared with Dylan .\n They both appeared in I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus and Just for Kicks , both of which were family films that received a direct-to-video release . David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews said of their acting in Just for Kicks that the brothers \" aren 't the worst child actors I 've ever seen , ... but they certainly leave a lot to be desired . \" Dylan and Cole were later cast in the Disney Channel original series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody , where they portrayed identical twins Zack and Cody Martin , respectively . The series , which debuted in March 2005 , became a ratings success . As part of their involvement with Disney , the brothers also became part of the 11-member group , the Disney Channel Circle of Stars , and sang the song \" A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes \" along with the members of the circle , for a video that was released as bonus material in the special edition version of the Disney film Cinderella .

However , in mid-2010 , Dylan stated that they would not be doing the movie , in part because they \" outgrew \" the movie . They became the new face of the children 's yogurt , <unk> <unk> , in 2009 ; their endorsement deal was renewed in 2010 . The twin brothers signed an endorsement deal with Nintendo DS in August 2010 .\n As of early to mid-2011 , Dylan and Cole are not in any acting projects and are focusing instead on college as well as art and photography , respectively . However , Dylan has stated that they would both like to continue acting while in college . Dylan and Cole are represented by William Morris Endeavor as of 2011 .",

      "Left": "An American patrol fired on Filipino troops , claiming afterwards that the Filipinos had started shooting first . The whole Filipino line from Pasay to Caloocan returned fire and the first battle of the Filipino-American War ensued . Two days later , in response to the incident , the US Senate voted for annexation . In doing so , the conflict became the war of conquest , occupation and annexation that Luna , Mabini , and others had predicted and about which they had warned Aguinaldo and his generals previously .\n Luna , after receiving orders from Aguinaldo , rushed to the front lines from his headquarters at Polo ( present-day Valenzuela City ) and led three companies to La Loma to engage General Arthur MacArthur 's forces . Fighting took place at Marikina , Caloocan , Santa Ana , and Paco . The Filipinos were subjected to a carefully planned attack with naval artillery , with Dewey 's US fleet firing from the Manila Bay . Filipino casualties were high , amounting to around 2,000 killed and wounded . Luna personally had to carry wounded officers and men to safety ; of these rescues , the most dramatic was that of Commander José Torres Bugallón . After being hit by an American bullet , Bugallón had managed to advance another fifty meters before he was seen by Luna to collapse by the side of the road . As the Americans kept up their fire on the road , Luna had to gather an escort of around 25 men to save Bugallón , who Luna declared was equivalent to 500 men . Surviving the encounter , Luna tried to encourage Bugallón to live and gave the latter an instant promotion to lieutenant colonel . However , Bugallón died thereafter .\n On 7 February , Luna issued a detailed order to the field officers of the territorial militia . Containing five specific objects , it began \" by virtue of the barbarous attack upon our army on February 4 , \" and ended with \" war without quarter to false Americans who wish to enslave us . Independence or death ! \" The order labeled the US forces \" an army of drunkards and thieves \" in response to the continued bombardment of the towns around Manila , the burning and looting of whole districts , and the raping of Filipino women by US troops .",
      "Right": "Nevertheless , with their superior firepower and newly arrived reinforcements , the Americans had not expected such resistance . They were so surprised that an urgent cable was sent to General Lawton who was in Colombo , Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) , with his troops . Illustrating the concern that the Americans had , the telegram stated , \" Situation critical in Manila . Your early arrival great importance . \"",
      "Passage": "When Luna saw that the American advance had halted , mainly to stabilize their lines , he again mobilized his troops to attack La Loma on February 10 . Fierce fighting ensued but the Filipinos were forced to withdraw thereafter . Caloocan was left with American forces in control of the southern terminus of the Manila to Dagupan railway , along with five engines , fifty passenger coaches , and a hundred freight cars . After consolidating control of Caloocan , the obvious next objective for American forces would be the Republic capital at Malolos . However , General Otis delayed for almost a month in hopes that Filipino forces would be deployed in its defense ."

      "Outcome1": "As the Filipinos suffered heavy losses and retreated from their positions, Luna did not give up the fight. He saw that the American advance had halted , mainly to stabilize their lines , and he again mobilized his troops to attack La Loma on February 10 . Fierce fighting ensued but the Filipinos were forced to withdraw thereafter . Caloocan was left with American forces in control of the southern terminus of the Manila to Dagupan railway , along with five engines , fifty passenger coaches , and a hundred freight cars . After consolidating control of Caloocan , the obvious next objective for American forces would be the Republic capital at Malolos . However , General Otis delayed for almost a month in hopes that Filipino forces would be deployed in its defense .",
      "Outcome2": "As Luna launched a counterattack on La Loma, the Americans seized Caloocan and its railway assets, and prepared to march on Malolos.",
      "Outcome3": "When Luna saw that the American advance had stalled , he seized the opportunity to launch a counterattack on La Loma on February 10 . He led his men with courage and determination , shouting \" Viva Filipinas ! \" as they charged the enemy positions . The battle was fierce and bloody , with both sides exchanging heavy fire and suffering many casualties . The Filipinos fought bravely but were outnumbered and outgunned by the Americans . They had to retreat under a hail of bullets and shells , leaving behind many dead and wounded comrades . Caloocan fell into American hands , giving them control of the vital railway line that connected Manila to the north . They also captured a large amount of rolling stock and supplies that the Filipinos had stored there . The Americans celebrated their victory with cheers and songs , while the Filipinos mourned their losses and prepared to defend their capital at Malolos . However , General Otis did not press his advantage immediately , hoping that the Filipinos would weaken their defenses by spreading out their forces .",
      "Outcome4": "On February 10 , Luna launched another assault on La Loma but failed to dislodge the Americans . They captured Caloocan and its railway assets , threatening the Republic capital at Malolos . General Otis waited for a month , hoping the Filipinos would defend it .",
      "Outcome5": "When Luna saw that the Americans stopped moving forward , he told his soldiers to attack them again on February 10 . They fought very hard but they had to run away later . The Americans took over a big town where there was a train station and many trains . They also wanted to take over the place where Aguinaldo and his friends lived . But they waited for a long time because they thought Luna and his soldiers would come back to stop them .",
      "Outcome6": "As Luna observed that the American offensive had come to a temporary standstill , he seized the opportunity to launch a counterattack on La Loma on February 10 . He led his troops in a fierce and bloody battle , hoping to retake the strategic position from the enemy . However , his efforts were in vain as the Filipinos faced overwhelming odds and had to retreat eventually . The Americans secured their hold on Caloocan , which gave them access to the railway system that connected Manila to Dagupan . They also captured a large number of locomotives and railcars that could be used for transportation and supply . With Caloocan under their control , the next logical target for the Americans was Malolos , the seat of the Philippine Republic . However , General Otis decided to wait for almost a month before advancing further , hoping that more Filipino forces would be lured into defending their capital .",

      "Left": "The C5 is made predominately of polypropylene , measuring 174.4 cm ( 68.7 in ) long , 74.4 cm ( 29.3 in ) wide , and 79.5 cm ( 31.3 in ) high . It weighs approximately 30 kg ( 66 lb ) without a battery and 45 kg ( 99 lb ) with one . The chassis consists of a single Y-shaped steel component with a cross-section of about 5.5 cm ( 2.2 in ) by 4 cm ( 1.6 in ) The vehicle has three wheels , one of 317 mm ( 12.5 in ) diameter at the front and two of 406 mm ( 16.0 in ) at the rear .\n The driver sits in a recumbent position in an open cockpit , steering via a handlebar that is located under the knees . A power switch and front and rear brake levers are positioned on the handlebar . As a supplement to or replacement for electric power , the C5 can also be propelled via bicycle-style pedals located at the front of the cockpit . The maximum speed of an unmodified C5 is 15 miles per hour ( 24 km / h ) . At the rear of the vehicle is a small luggage compartment with a capacity of 28 litres ( 1 cu ft ) . As the C5 does not have a reverse gear , reversing direction is done by getting out , picking up the front end and turning it around by hand .",
      "Right": "Although it was usually billed as an electric vehicle , the C5 also depends significantly on pedal power . The vehicle 's battery is designed to provide 35 amps per hour when fully charged or half that for two hours , giving the C5 a claimed range of 20 miles ( 32 km ) . A display in the cockpit uses green , amber , and red LEDs to display the state of the battery charge . The segments are extinguished one after the other to indicate how much driving time is left . The last light indicates that only ten minutes of power are left , after which the motor is switched off and the driver is left to rely on the pedals . Another display indicates via green , amber , and red LEDs how much current is being used . The C5 is in its most economical running mode when a low amount of current , indicated by the green LEDs , is being used . When the lights are red , the motor is under a high load and the driver needs to use pedal power to avoid overheating and shutdown .\n The C5 was initially sold at a cost of £ 399 , but to keep the cost under the £ 400 mark a number of components were sold as optional accessories . These included indicator lights , mirrors , mud flaps , a horn , and a \" High-Vis Mast \" consisting of a reflective strip on a pole , designed to make the C5 more visible in traffic . Sinclair 's C5 accessories brochure noted that \" the British climate isn 't always ideal for wind-in-the-hair driving \" and offered a range of waterproofs to keep C5 drivers dry in the vehicle 's open cockpit . Other accessories included seat cushions and spare batteries .",
      "Passage": "The C5 is powered by a 12-volt lead-acid electric battery which drives a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute . It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13 , without which the motor would not be able to move the vehicle when a person is on board . However , the motor is vulnerable to overheating . The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases , for instance by going up too steep a gradient . Sinclair 's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 ( 8 % ) and could manage a 1 in 7 ( 14 % ) slope using the pedals . As the speed of the motor reduces , the current flow through its windings increases , drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed . This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained , so the motor 's load is constantly monitored by the C5 's electronics . If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds , while if it is under heavy load ( around 80 or 90 amps ) it trips after two or three minutes . A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time , and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor . If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected ."

      "Outcome1": "The C5 runs on a big battery that makes a small engine spin fast . It has some gears that make the engine more powerful , but also more likely to get too hot . The C5 can tell when the engine is working too hard and will turn it off to cool down . It can also warn the driver with a light if the engine is getting warm . There is another light that shows how much power is left in the battery . The C5 can go up small hills , but not big ones . If the hill is too steep or the battery runs out , the driver can use pedals like on a bike to move the C5 .",
      "Outcome2": "One of the main features of the C5 is its electric motor , which provides power to the vehicle . However , the motor is not very robust and can easily overheat under heavy load . To prevent this , the C5 has a sophisticated electronic system that monitors the motor 's performance and shuts it off if necessary . Additionally , a heat-sensitive resistor and a metallic strip act as backup safety measures in case of excessive temperature . Despite these precautions , the motor can only handle a limited slope and speed , and depends on the driver 's pedalling to assist it .",
      "Outcome3": "Some features of the C5's power system are:\n\n- It uses a 12-volt lead-acid electric battery that drives a 250-watt motor with a two-stage gear-drive\n- It has a maximum speed of 15 mph (24 km/h) and a range of 20 miles (32 km) on a full charge\n- It has an electronic system that monitors the motor's load and temperature and cuts off the power if it overheats or stalls\n- It can also be pedaled like a bicycle, which is necessary when the battery runs out or the motor shuts down\n- It has LED displays that show the battery charge and the current usage",
      "Outcome4": "The C5 runs on a 12-volt battery that powers a 250-watt motor with a gear-drive to boost torque . The motor can overheat if the load is too high , so the C5 has electronic sensors and thermal protectors to cut off power if needed . The motor can handle slopes up to 8 % , but steeper ones require pedaling . The battery lasts for about 20 miles ( 32 km ) or two hours , and the cockpit has LED displays to show the charge level and the current usage . Pedaling is also needed to save battery power and prevent overheating .",
      "Outcome5": "There is a big battery inside the C5 that makes it go . It is like a toy car , but bigger and you can sit in it . The battery gives power to a spinning thing called a motor . The motor makes the wheels turn and move the C5 forward . But sometimes the motor gets too hot and needs to rest . Then you have to use your feet to make the wheels turn , like on a bike . There is a light that tells you how much power the battery has left , and another light that tells you how hard the motor is working . You want to keep both lights green as much as possible , because that means the battery will last longer and the motor will not get too hot .",
      "Outcome6": "One of the main features of the C5 is its 12-volt lead-acid electric battery , which provides power to a motor that has a continuous rating of 250 watts and can reach a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute . The motor is connected to a two-stage gear-drive system that boosts the torque by a factor of 13 , making it possible for the motor to move the vehicle with a person on board . However , this also makes the motor prone to overheating under heavy load or steep incline . The C5 's electronics are designed to monitor the motor 's load and prevent it from burning out by cutting off the power if it reaches a critical level . There are also several indicators and sensors that warn the driver if the motor is getting too hot and need to cool down . In addition to electric power , the C5 can also be driven by bicycle-style pedals located at the front of the cockpit , which can be used as a supplement or an alternative to the battery . The maximum speed that an unmodified C5 can achieve is 15 miles per hour ( 24 km / h ) .",

Also, sometimes you may want to be like the people who are famous because they have a lot of money and nice things. You may want to be in movies or play sports like them.

Tkach asked the church leadership to study the question . Once Tkach was satisfied with the results of the study , he officially softened the church 's teaching on the matter , encouraging members to seek proper treatment while retaining faith in God as a healer .\n Another officially published doctrinal change was that women in the church would be allowed to wear makeup . In the earliest years of the denomination , Armstrong announced the prohibition of makeup for women . In the 1970s that prohibition was lifted , but in 1981 Armstrong reinstituted the teaching . In 1988 Tkach lifted the ban for good .",

The church leadership at that time included Mike Feazell , executive assistant and editorial advisor to Tkach , Greg Albrecht , editor of The Plain Truth , and Joseph Tkach , Jr . , the son of Joseph W. Tkach , and church administration director . One conspiracy theory stated that the decisions did not come from Tkach himself but from the church leadership . Another stated that the ideas did originate from Tkach but he formed them early in his career , kept them hidden from Armstrong , and only allowed the ideas to come to fruition after Armstrong 's death . Feazell claims that the reforms were initially driven by a re-examination of church literature that was mainly spurred by questions posed by church ministers and members . These examinations were done by Tkach and Feazell , but the final decisions and approval of materials for publication were made by Tkach . By 1990 , Tkach authorized the formation of a \" Doctrinal Manual Group \" , consisting of thirteen ministers and Ambassador College faculty members with the mission of assuring doctrinal consistency , refinement , and advice to the Pastor General . Tkach reviewed and made the final decisions on all recommendations made by the group .\n The church 's traditions of following the Sabbath , the Old Testament holy days , and tithing were initially retained . But some WCG ministers and members continued to express alarm over the doctrinal revisions Tkach had already made , and from time to time some would leave to create dissident branches . They included Tkach 's one-time mentor , Roderick C. Meredith , who formed the Global Church of God in 1992 . As various breakaway groups were established , additional clusters of church members followed .",

The PCG began an alternative radio program and magazine , and over the next several years a few thousand WCG members left to join the PCG . Despite this , Tkach continued to implement additional changes in thinking including : the shift in emphasis away from observing world events primarily through the lens of prophetic interpretation ; the removal of the prohibition of interracial marriage ; the allowance of work on the Sabbath ; the acceptance of the trinitarian doctrine ; and the acceptance of the validity of other Christian denominations , among many other changes . Older Armstrong publications that supported the church 's once unique doctrines were allowed to go out-of-print ."

      "Outcome1": "One of the first instances of unrest within the WCG came in 1989 , when Gerald <unk> , a WCG minister , circulated a document that criticized what he saw as troubling changes in the church 's teachings and practices . He and his colleague John Amos were expelled from the church and founded the Philadelphia Church of God ( PCG ) . The PCG launched its own radio show and magazine , and attracted several thousand former WCG members over the next few years . Tkach , however , did not back down from his reform agenda , which included : moving away from a prophetic interpretation of world events ; lifting the ban on interracial marriage ; allowing work on the Sabbath ; adopting the trinitarian doctrine ; and recognizing other Christian denominations as valid , among many other changes . He also discontinued many of the publications that had promoted Armstrong 's distinctive doctrines . In a 1990 letter to The Plain Truth subscribers , Tkach explained his rationale for these changes : \" We are not changing our beliefs to conform to this world 's thinking or to any human tradition or philosophy . Rather , we are seeking to conform our beliefs more fully to God 's Word \" ( Tkach 1990 ) . To ensure doctrinal consistency and accuracy , Tkach appointed a \" Doctrinal Manual Group \" in 1990 , composed of thirteen ministers and Ambassador College faculty members who would review and advise him on doctrinal matters . Tkach had the final say on all doctrinal decisions .",
      "Outcome2": "One of the first areas of controversy that emerged under Tkach 's leadership was the WCG 's doctrine on healing . Previously the church taught that true believers were healed by faith in God and not by doctors . Tkach asked the church leadership to study the question . Once Tkach was satisfied with the results of the study , he officially softened the church 's teaching on the matter , encouraging members to seek proper treatment while retaining faith in God as a healer .\n Another change that signaled a departure from Armstrong 's teachings was that women in the church would be allowed to wear makeup . In the earliest years of the denomination , Armstrong announced the prohibition of makeup for women . In the 1970s that prohibition was lifted , but in 1981 Armstrong reinstituted the teaching . In 1988 Tkach lifted the ban for good .\n However, not everyone in the church was happy with these changes. The first major sign of dissent occurred in 1989 when a WCG minister , Gerald <unk> , published a manuscript outlining what he and others believed were disturbing trends in the work , including the beginnings of the doctrinal departure from what had been established by Armstrong . <unk> and another minister , John Amos , were disfellowshipped and went on to form the Philadelphia Church of God ( PCG ) .

The PCG launched an alternative radio program and magazine, and over the next several years a few thousand WCG members joined them. Tkach did not stop implementing additional changes in thinking, such as: shifting the emphasis away from interpreting world events mainly through prophecy; removing the ban on interracial marriage; allowing work on the Sabbath; adopting the trinitarian doctrine; and recognizing other Christian denominations as valid, among many other changes. Older Armstrong publications that supported the church's once unique doctrines went out-of-print .",
      "Outcome4": "In 1989, WCG minister Gerald <unk> challenged the doctrinal changes initiated by Tkach and was expelled. He founded the Philadelphia Church of God ( PCG ) and attracted some WCG members. Tkach kept introducing more reforms, such as allowing interracial marriage, working on the Sabbath, accepting the Trinity, and recognizing other Christian groups. He also discontinued old Armstrong publications that supported the former doctrines.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people in the church did not like the new things that Tkach was teaching . They thought he was changing what God wanted them to do . One man , Gerald <unk> , wrote a paper about why he did not like the new things . He and his friend John Amos were told to leave the church . They started their own church and called it the Philadelphia Church of God ( PCG ) . They made a radio show and a magazine to tell people about their church . Some people from the old church liked their ideas and joined them . But Tkach did not stop teaching new things . He said that some of the old rules were not important anymore , like who you can marry , or what day you can work , or what God is like , or who are God 's friends . He also said that some of the books that they used to read were wrong and he did not want to print them anymore .",

The PCG sought to continue the legacy of Armstrong by producing a radio program and a magazine that mirrored his teachings . Over the next several years , they attracted a few thousand former WCG members who were unhappy with Tkach 's reforms . Despite this opposition , Tkach did not stop making changes in the church 's beliefs and practices .

The performance begins with an opening montage about how people should \" speak now \" about how they feel , and Swift then raises from a cloud of smoke and sings \" Drop everything now \" before starting the actual song performance . Swift also uses a longer interlude into the final chorus of the song . Fireworks were also used during the performance .

Yount had previously spent decades exploring the mountain country of present-day Wyoming , including the Grand Tetons , after joining F V. Hayden 's Geological Survey in 1873 . Yount is the first national park ranger , and Yount 's Peak , at the head of the Yellowstone River , was named in his honor . However , these measures still proved to be insufficient in protecting the park , as neither Norris , nor the three superintendents who followed , were given sufficient manpower or resources .\n The Northern Pacific Railroad built a train station in Livingston , Montana , connecting to the northern entrance in the early 1880s , which helped to increase visitation from 300 in 1872 to 5,000 in 1883 . Visitors in these early years faced poor roads and limited services , and most access into the park was on horse or via stagecoach . By 1908 visitation increased enough to attract a Union Pacific Railroad connection to West Yellowstone , though rail visitation fell off considerably by World War II and ceased around the 1960s . Much of the railroad line was converted to nature trails , among them the Yellowstone Branch Line Trail .\n During the 1870s and 1880s Native American tribes were effectively excluded from the national park . Under a half-dozen tribes had made seasonal use of the Yellowstone area , but the only year-round residents were small bands of Eastern Shoshone known as \" Sheepeaters \" .",

His report included Grinnell's account of the slaughter of wildlife.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people went to see a very big and beautiful park with many animals and hot water that shoots up from the ground. They saw that some bad people were killing the animals and breaking the park, and they told the government to stop them. The government said yes, and they chose a man to take care of the park, but they did not give him any money or helpers. The man tried his best, but he could not stop the bad people by himself. He wrote a letter to the government and said that the park was very special and many people would want to see it, so they should protect it better. Another man also wrote a letter about the park, and he said that he saw many animals being killed for their skin. The first man had to leave his job, and another man took his place. The government gave him some money and helpers, and he made some roads and buildings in the park. He also hired a man who knew a lot about animals to watch over them and stop anyone who tried to hurt them. But there were still too many bad people, and they needed more money and helpers to keep them away. Some people came to the park on a big metal snake that ran on fire, and they liked what they saw. More people wanted to come, so they made another metal snake that came from a different place. But later, people stopped using the metal snakes and used cars instead. Some of the metal snake roads became paths for walking or biking.",
      "Outcome6": "After Yellowstone was officially established as a national park, the first person to take charge of its administration was Nathaniel Langford, who received the appointment of superintendent in 1872. However, Langford faced many challenges in his role, as he did not receive any salary, funding, or staff from the government. He had no authority to enforce any rules or regulations to protect the park from the threats of poachers, vandals, and resource exploiters. He tried to address these issues in his 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior, where he also highlighted the unique and magnificent features of Yellowstone and predicted that it would become a world-renowned attraction that deserved the ongoing care and stewardship of the government. In 1875, another expedition was sent to Montana and Yellowstone under the leadership of Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored parts of Montana with George Armstrong Custer. Ludlow's report included observations and testimonies from other members of the expedition, such as naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell provided evidence of the widespread poaching of wildlife in the park, especially buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope. He estimated that thousands of animals were killed for their hides during the winter of 1874-1875. Due to his inability to improve or protect the park, Langford resigned from his position in 1877. James Norris, who had visited Yellowstone and witnessed its problems firsthand, volunteered to take over as superintendent after Langford's departure. Congress finally agreed to pay a salary for the superintendent position and allocate a small amount of money for park operations. Norris used this money to build more roads and facilities in the park to increase access for visitors.",

      "Left": "The practical spirit of the Dutch merchant could not fail to recognize that the way to riches was through trade with the West Indies and Africa . During the Twelve Years ' Truce , Dutch merchants had sailed unmolested to the West Indies but also received no letters of marque to take prizes from the enemy .\n Before the Eighty Years ' War began , people realized that the West Indies trade might bring great prosperity to the country and that more power might be developed against Spain . Rather than travel to the area singly on an armed ship or in the company of a few other vessels , traders could do business in the manner of the large and prosperous East India Company . A company for carrying on commerce in the West Indies and Africa could be organized , which might , like the sister company , act as the war-waging power in those parts and be supported by the treasury , ships , and troops of the United Netherlands .\n After long years of preparation , the Charter of the Dutch West India Company was granted by the States General on June 3 , 1621 , and the subscription list was opened . It is known that subscriptions did not come in very rapidly at first due to the exclusion of the salt trade from the charter . This barrier was overcome in a later amendment to the Charter , and the subscription rate increased .\n With a capital of seven million florins , the West India Company was granted exclusive authority and trade privileges in the Dutch possessions of the two Americas , as well as the coast of Africa from the Tropic of Cancer to the Cape of Good Hope . The objects of its creation were to establish an efficient and aggressive Atlantic maritime power in the struggle with Spain , as well as to colonize , develop , and rule the Dutch American dependencies — particularly New Netherland ( the modern states of New York and New Jersey ) , discovered by Henry Hudson in 1609 .\n Van Rensselaer was one of the first subscribers to the West India Company . As with the other subscribers , he contributed 6000 guilders to be a member of one of its chambers . Having paid his way , he was welcomed to the Chamber of Amsterdam , one of five Chambers of the West India Company , each located in a principal Dutch city . The Chamber of Amsterdam was the largest with twenty members , mainly due to the city 's population , and represented four ninths of the management of the West India Company .",
      "Right": "In its role supporting colonization of New Netherland , the West India Company had an executive board of nine members from the College of XIX to manage the concerns of their colony . Van Rensselaer was also a member of this group . In the early career of the Company , van Rensselaer was one of its mainstays , placing several of his vessels at its disposal and twice advancing money to save its credit . His name is conspicuously identified with all its measures of policy , including the original settlement of Manhattan Island , New Amsterdam .",
      "Passage": "Due to the practical limitations of meetings with 74 members on a regular basis ( the total number of members from the five Chambers ) , the Charter called for a board of directors comprising nineteen members of the five Chambers . Van Rensselaer was chosen a member of this College of XIX , as it was called . It is said that care was exercised in the selection of the directors of each chamber , and only men of wealth and the highest known integrity were eligible for the trust . Van Rensselaer was apparently known as an unusually clear-headed man and an able and practical merchant who did not limit himself to his own branch of trade . These qualities presumably garnered the trust needed to be elected to the College of XIX ."

People said they were careful when they chose the leaders of each chamber , and only rich men and very honest men could do the job .

He was also selected to serve on a smaller executive board that handled the colonization and administration of New Netherland , the Dutch territory in North America . Van Rensselaer was not only a generous patron who lent his ships and money to support the Company 's operations , but also a visionary leader who helped shape its policies and strategies . He was involved in the founding and development of New Amsterdam , the future New York City , as well as other settlements along the Hudson River .",

The West India Company had many people who gave money to join the group , but they also had some people who made decisions for the group . Van Rensselaer was one of those people . He gave a lot of money and he was very smart and good at his job . He helped the West India Company do many things , like making a new home for some people on an island called Manhattan , where New York City is now .",
      "Outcome6": "As a result of his early subscription to the West India Company , van Rensselaer became a member of the Chamber of Amsterdam , one of the five administrative divisions of the Company that were based in different Dutch cities . The Chamber of Amsterdam had the largest share and influence in the Company , with twenty members who represented four ninths of its total management . Since it was impractical to convene all 74 members from the five Chambers for regular meetings , the Charter established a smaller board of directors that consisted of nineteen representatives from the different Chambers . This board was known as the College of XIX and van Rensselaer was elected to join it as one of its esteemed members . Only men who had proven their wealth and integrity in business were eligible for this trust . Van Rensselaer had earned a reputation as a clear-headed , able , and practical merchant who was not confined to his own branch of trade . These qualities presumably made him a trusted and valuable member of the College of XIX .",

      "Left": "At one point , Carter Jenkins was set to play Hal , but NBC blocked this as he was contracted for further episodes of Surface . HBO Films told the producers after six months of searching for a Hal that it would abandon the project if a lead actor was not found in two weeks , at which point a desperate Jeffrey Blitz watched all of the unsolicited audition tapes that he had been sent and \" knew immediately we had a promising candidate \" when he saw Thompson 's tape . Although a casting call was originally posted for a teenage boy aged 13 – 18 who had a stutter and could also act , Thompson had previously been taught how to stutter . However Blitz wanted Hal to stutter in a different style , knowing he was going to block up on a particular word and looking for ways to work round it . Before filming , Thompson was taught this specific style by a speech pathologist .\n Anna Kendrick plays Ginny Ryerson , the ambitious and competitive star of the Plainsboro High School debate team . Anna Kendrick was one of the first cast members to sign on to the film . Blitz recalls writing \" Anna Kendrick is Ginny Ryerson \" after her audition and , after auditioning many other girls , she was cast . To prepare for her role , Kendrick learned the typical debating strategy of \" spreading \" , a rapid-fire delivery used in order to present as much evidence and information as possible within a time limit . Kendrick and Nicholas D 'Agosto studied with a college debate coach and also viewed a live high school debate . Ginny 's comment \" I upped your game , little man \" was inserted into the script by Blitz from a journal which he asked Kendrick to write in character .\n Nicholas D 'Agosto plays Ben <unk> , Ginny 's former debate partner who dropped out of high school to work at a dry cleaners after falling silent <unk> and losing the championship trophy . \" Nick takes his work very seriously — it 's an approach that 's very much like Ben , in my mind , \" said Blitz of D 'Agosto , calling his performance \" just right \" . D 'Agosto joked about his being cast as a high school student , having been cast as a student previously in Election , which was released eight years before Rocket Science , in 1999 . Like Kendrick , D 'Agosto had to learn a number of debating techniques to prepare for his role .",
      "Right": "Aaron Yoo plays Heston , Hal and Earl 's bi-curious school friend who ends up joining Hal in the debate team . \" Aaron made Heston almost an alien among the kids of New Jersey . He 's never quite connected to the scene but he 's always aware of it , \" said Blitz about Yoo 's performance as Heston . He says Yoo was cast because of the \" dramatic decisions \" he brought to Heston 's portrayal \" from the start \" .\n Josh Kay plays Lewis <unk> , an eleven-year-old boy whom Hal befriends while loitering in the street outside Ginny 's house . Blitz was pleased with Kay 's original audition : \" When Josh Kay came in to audition in New York , it was instantly obvious that he was perfect : smart , deadpan and with a natural ability to either nail the timing of the lines himself or mimic my reading to him . \" \n  Denis O 'Hare plays Doyle Hefner , Hal 's father who walks out on the family abruptly , following an argument with his wife about suitcases . Denis O 'Hare originally auditioned in 2005 for an alternate role , and , describing O 'Hare as a \" must-have \" , Blitz had him re-audition at a different session in the role of Doyle . Because of scheduling conflicts , O 'Hare was only available for filming on two days of production : the first day and the last , filming one of the first scenes of the film and also the final scene .\n Maury Ginsberg plays Mr. Lewinsky , Hal 's vain speech therapist who offers no successful advice . The character was based on Blitz 's own experiences as a youth with many well-meaning but mostly ineffective therapists when he sought treatments to his stutter .\n Jonah Hill plays the Junior Philosopher , a teenager Hal meets in the library while studying for the policy debate with Ginny . Hill had initially auditioned for another role in the film , but was unavailable as he was shooting another film at the same time . Blitz was keen to have him appear , though , and so wrote him a small role as the Junior Philosopher , appearing in only two scenes .\n Dan Cashman voices the narrator .",
      "Passage": "Vincent Piazza plays Earl Hefner , Hal 's obsessive-compulsive , <unk> older brother . Vincent Piazza was studying at the New York acting school where Rocket Science casting sessions were being held ; he decided to audition and was one of the first actors to be cast . When he first auditioned , he spoke with a lisp , said Blitz : \" I eventually decided to do away with the lisp — one major speech impediment per family is plenty — but kept many of the rest of the choices Vince brought to Earl . \" Blitz cited Piazza 's portrayal of Earl as an example of \" the strong choices that actors make in interpreting their character \" ."

      "Left": "And what's helpful is that in the civilian literature, there has been a lot of research done on violence risk assessment.\n So what I'm going to be presenting today is research that has been done mostly based on a national institute of mental health grant that aimed to create and adapt the tools that have been used for civilian violence risk assessment and adapt them and transfer that same science to Veterans. and the idea of which is, we're going to also be looking at, because we have a good mixture of both clinicians and researchers on the phone, is how the research can be transferred to clinical practice. And I'm going to be offering four rules of thumb for improving your decision making of violence risk when working with Veterans that is directly based on the research that me and other people have conducted.\n The first rule of thumb is: if you're going to look at anything, look at factors that have been shown scientifically to be associated with violent behavior in Veterans and military populations.\n So what I want you to do is to think about a Veteran that you may have seen recently who anger or aggression were problems that they were complaining about, think about or write down 3 factors that you think are important to assess whether they are at risk of violence.\n Moderator: So as you can see, this isn't a regular poll. We just want you to give this some thought and if you need to you can jot them down on your own, or if you really want to remember it, you can type it into the question section to see it later.\n Dr. Eric Elbogen: That being said, we are going to do a regular poll right now, which is: Which of these factors do you think is the strongest predictor of violence in Veteran and military populations?\n Moderator: Perfect, so for our attendees, that is up on the screen at this time. So what risk factor do you think is the strongest predictor of violence among military service members and Veterans? Younger age, PTSD, Traumatic Brain Injury, male gender, or financial instability.\n And people are a little bit slower to answer this one, and that is perfectly fine, take your time. These are anonymous responses and we are not grading you. Alright, it looks like we've got up to about 75 percent, a little over, so I am going to close it out and share those results.",
      "Right": "Dr. Eric Elbogen: I apologize for this, but there is no right answer. I know that that's probably not what you want to hear but there is a reason I do this, is because it turns out that you should never rely on a single factor for assessing violence, and one of those factors might be stronger than another, or they may be combined with one another in different models. So we do know about the strength of the individual factors, and what I can tell you is that younger age, which was not very consistently answered, is actually been consistently related to increased risk of violence, as is financial instability. Male gender has not been consistent, there is not a consistent association among Veterans of being male and being aggressive. Traumatic Brain Injury also has not been consistently related to aggression and violence in Veterans. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder has been shown to consistently relate, but there is a few caveats, and we are going to talk about those in a few minutes, but the foreshadow of that is that it's PTSD and something else that really increases the risk of violence. You want to go beyond the diagnosis of PTSD for finding the link to violence.\n That being said, this is a listing, anything you see a check mark for has in four or more empirical studies been shown to be associated statistically with violence and aggression in Veterans or military populations, divided into domestic violence and general interpersonal violence. You can see younger age, just like in the civilian population, past violent behavior, just like in the civilian population, maltreatment and abuse as a child. Combat exposure is interesting and maybe some of you wrote those down in that open ended question. There have been studies that have shown it is associated but then there are studies that have not. Now, there have been four more studies that have, but that shows that there is actually mixed evidence for that, and often times it is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and severe PTSD symptoms that's contributing most to the association, not combat exposure.\n Many of you may have written substance abuse, depression, and financial status, have all been linked to violence in Veteran populations. So the first rule of thumb, if you are going to be assessing risk of violence, you want to base it on what has empirically been shown to relate to future and current violent risk in the Veterans. The second is to figure out the role of PTSD.",

      "Outcome4": "Here are the results of our poll: 8% said younger age; 41% said PTSD; 12% said TBI; 27% said male gender; and 13% said financial instability. Back to you, Eric.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people answered this question: What makes someone more likely to hurt other people after they were in the army? There is not one thing that makes someone more likely to hurt others, but there are some things that we know can make it harder for them to be nice and calm. We learned this by asking a lot of people who were in the army questions about their lives and what they did. Some of the things that can make it harder for them are: being very young, hurting other people before, having bad things happen to them when they were little, seeing scary things in the war, feeling very sad or worried, drinking too much alcohol or taking drugs, having trouble with money, or having a problem in their brain that makes them forget things or act differently.",
      "Outcome6": "Here are the results of our poll question. We asked you to choose one risk factor that you think is the strongest predictor of violence among military service members and Veterans. As you can see, the responses were quite varied. Eight percent of you chose younger age; forty one percent of you chose PTSD; twelve percent of you chose TBI; twenty seven percent of you chose male gender; and thirteen percent of you chose financial instability. I appreciate your participation, but I have to tell you that this was a trick question. The reason is that there is no single factor that can accurately predict violence, and depending on the situation, different factors may have different levels of influence or interaction. So let me share with you some of the evidence we have about the individual factors, and how they relate to violence in Veteran and military populations.",

A guardian for an adult does not have the authority to revoke or change a power of attorney for health care or an advance health care directive or power of attorney for finances that the adult has executed, unless the court grants that authority by a specific order. If the adult has a valid power of attorney for health care or an advance health care directive, the agent's health care decisions take priority over the guardian's, unless the court orders otherwise. The guardian must cooperate with the agent as much as possible. The same rule applies to a power of attorney for finances: the agent's decisions prevail over the guardian's, unless the court says otherwise, and the guardian must cooperate with the agent as much as possible.\n\nLimitations on commitment to mental health facility. A guardian for an adult cannot start the process of committing the adult to a mental health facility on their own. The guardian must follow the State's procedure for involuntary civil commitment under Title 34-B, chapter 3, subchapter 4, article 3.\n\nLimitations on contact restrictions. A guardian for an adult cannot limit the adult's ability to communicate, visit or interact with other people, such as by receiving visitors or phone calls, sending or receiving mail or electronic messages, including through social media, or joining social activities. The only exception is if:\nThe guardian has a good reason to believe that contact with someone would cause significant physical, psychological or financial harm to the adult. The guardian must notify the court and explain why they are restricting contact. The notice must include a description of the restriction, contact information of the court and information about how to object to it.",

Unless authorized by the court by specific order, a guardian for an adult does not have the power to revoke or amend a power of attorney for health care or an advance health care directive or power of attorney for finances executed by the adult. If a power of attorney for health care or an advance health care directive is in effect, unless there is a court order to the contrary, a health care decision of an agent takes precedence over that of the guardian and the guardian shall cooperate with the agent to the extent feasible. If a power of attorney for finances is in effect, unless there is a court order to the contrary, a decision by the agent that the agent is authorized to make under the power of attorney for finances takes precedence over that of the guardian and the guardian shall cooperate with the agent to the extent feasible.",
      "Outcome4": "Limitations; health care; finances. A guardian for an adult needs a specific court order to change or cancel a power of attorney for health care or finances made by the adult. If such a power of attorney is valid, the agent's decision has priority over the guardian's and the guardian must cooperate with the agent, unless the court orders otherwise.",
      "Outcome5": "Limitations; health care; finances. A guardian is someone who helps an adult who cannot make good choices by themselves. Sometimes, the adult has already picked someone else to help them with their health or money. The guardian cannot change or cancel that choice unless the judge says so. If the adult has someone else to help them with their health or money, the guardian should listen to that person and work with them.",
      "Outcome6": "Limitations on the authority of the guardian regarding health care and financial matters. A guardian for an adult does not have the authority to revoke or amend any power of attorney for health care or an advance health care directive or power of attorney for finances that the adult has executed, unless the court gives the guardian specific permission to do so by a separate order. If the adult has a valid power of attorney for health care or an advance health care directive, the guardian must respect the decisions made by the agent appointed by the adult, unless there is a court order that says otherwise. The guardian must also cooperate with the agent as much as possible. Similarly, if the adult has a valid power of attorney for finances, the guardian must respect and cooperate with the decisions made by the agent within the scope of their authority, unless there is a court order that says otherwise.",

For example, it needs to process your data to provide you with an employment contract, to pay you in accordance with your employment contract and to administer for example PAYE benefits, and pensions.\n In some cases, the Council needs to process data to ensure that it is complying with its legal obligations. For example, it is required to check an employee's entitlement to work in the UK, to deduct tax, to comply with health and safety laws and to enable employees to take periods of leave to which they are entitled. For certain positions, it is necessary to carry out criminal records checks to ensure that individuals are permitted to undertake the role in question.\n In other cases, the Council has a lawful basis in processing personal data under the condition 'necessary for contract' before, during and after the end of the employment relationship. Processing employee data allows the Council to run recruitment and promotion processes;\nmaintain accurate and up-to-date employment records and contact details (including details of who to contact in the event of an emergency), and records of employee contractual and statutory rights;\noperate and keep a record of disciplinary and grievance processes, to ensure acceptable conduct within the workplace;\noperate and keep a record of employee performance and related processes, to plan for career development, and for succession planning and workforce management purposes;\noperate and keep a record of absence and absence management procedures, to allow effective workforce management and ensure that employees are receiving the pay or other benefits to which they are entitled;\nobtain occupational health advice, to ensure that it complies with duties in relation to individuals with disabilities, meet its obligations under health and safety law, and ensure that employees are receiving the pay or other benefits to which they are entitled;\noperate and keep a record of other types of leave (including maternity, paternity, adoption, parental and shared parental leave), to allow effective workforce management, to ensure that the Council complies with duties in relation to leave entitlement, and to ensure that employees are receiving the pay or other benefits to which they are entitled;\nensure effective general HR and business administration;\nprovide references on request for current or former employees;\nrespond to and defend against legal claims; and\nmaintain and promote equality in the workplace.",
      "Right": "Who has access to data?\n Your information will be shared internally, including with members of HR (including payroll), your line manager, managers in the business area in which you work, finance department and IT staff if access to the data is necessary for performance of their roles.\n The Council shares your data with third parties in order to obtain pre-employment references from other employers, obtain employment background checks from third-party providers and obtain necessary criminal records checks from the Disclosure and Barring Service. The Council may also share your data with third parties in the context of a transfer of some of our business. In those circumstances the data will be subject to confidentiality arrangements.\n The Council also shares your data with third parties that process data on its behalf, in connection with payroll, the provision of benefits and the provision of occupational health services. It also shares data with HMRC and the National Fraud Initiative in order to assist in the prevention and detection of crime or fraud. The Council will not transfer your data to countries outside the European Economic Area.\n How does the Council protect data?\n The Council takes the security of your data seriously. The Council has internal policies and controls in place to try to ensure that your data is not lost, accidentally destroyed, misused or disclosed, and is not accessed except by its employees in the performance of their duties.\n Where the Council engages third parties to process personal data on its behalf, they do so on the basis of written instructions, are under a duty of confidentiality and are obliged to implement appropriate technical and Council measures to ensure the security of data.\n For how long does the Council keep data?\n The Council will hold your personal data for the duration of your employment.

So the Council keeps them safe and only tells them to people who really need them, like your boss or the doctor. The Council also asks other people, like your old boss or the police, if they know anything about you that might be important for your work. The Council does this because they want to make sure you are happy and safe at work.\nSometimes the Council also wants to know other things about you that are not so special, like what kind of food you like or what games you play.

      "Left": "The idea of creating a Hogwarts Express-related attraction came from Mark Woodbury , the president of Universal Creative . After the opening of the Hogsmeade attraction at the Islands of Adventure theme park in 2010 , Universal began considering how to keep attendance balanced between the adjacent parks . At first , the creative team considered putting Diagon Alley within Islands of Adventure . Eventually they decided that the London and Hogsmeade environments should not be visible between one another . As a result , Woodbury proposed building Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida and then connecting the two Harry Potter-themed lands with the Hogwarts Express train .",
      "Right": "On 8 May 2013 , Universal Orlando announced the expansion of Wizarding World of Harry Potter , Diagon Alley , along with the Hogwarts Express attraction , to be located on the former site of the Jaws attraction . By the end of August 2013 , all six passenger cars and both tenders had been spotted in the backstage area , waiting to be assembled on the track . The first of the two trains was installed on the track on 24 October 2013 . By the beginning of December 2013 , the second train had been placed on the track . In January , the resort previewed the interior of the Hogwarts Express through a live cast . On 2 December 2013 , Orlando Attractions Magazine , an amusement park website , spotted one of the trains being tested for the first time . In mid-March 2014 , Universal Orlando Resort released further information about the ride , including concept animations . On 24 June 2014 , the resort announced that the Diagon Alley expansion , including the Hogwarts Express , would officially open to the public on 8 July 2014 . A week later , Universal Orlando soft-opened the Hogwarts Express , without any announcement . Within a month of the Hogwarts Express ' opening , one million riders had ridden the attraction . It had taken approximately two and a half years to develop .",
      "Passage": "Rumours that Universal Orlando was planning to expand The Wizarding World of Harry Potter began in early 2011 after construction surveying was spotted in the Lost Continent section of Islands of Adventure and the resort began asking visitors about a possible expansion .

      "Outcome1": "While Universal Orlando was working on the expansion of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, some hints and clues about the project began to emerge in 2011. The resort confirmed that the Jaws attraction would close in January 2012 to make room for a new attraction, but did not reveal any details. Meanwhile, fans and media speculated that the new attraction would be Diagon Alley, a famous wizarding shopping district from the Harry Potter books and films, and that it would be connected to the existing Hogsmeade area in Islands of Adventure by the Hogwarts Express, a magical train that transports students to and from the school of witchcraft and wizardry. These rumours were supported by evidence of construction permits and track installation between the two parks. Tom Williams, chairman and CEO of Universal Parks & Resorts, said in an interview that \"we always knew we had more stories to tell\" with Harry Potter. He also praised the collaboration with Warner Bros. and J.K. Rowling, the author of the series, who were closely involved in the creative process. In June 2013, Universal Orlando officially announced Diagon Alley and Hogwarts Express as part of their expansion plans. Fans reacted with excitement and anticipation to the news. \"I think it's amazing that they're making Diagon Alley,\" said Emma Watson, a visitor from London who shares her name with one of the Harry Potter actors. \"It's one of my favourite places in the books and I can't wait to see it come to life.\" Another fan, Daniel Gonzalez from Miami, said he was most looking forward to riding the Hogwarts Express. \"It's such an iconic part of Harry Potter,\" he said. \"I've always dreamed of boarding that train and seeing what it's like inside.\"",
      "Outcome2": "Early in 2011 , rumours of a planned expansion for The Wizarding World of Harry Potter started to circulate after construction surveying appeared in the Lost Continent section of Islands of Adventure and the resort asked visitors about a possible expansion . The resort announced on 2 December 2011 that it would close the Jaws attraction on 2 January 2012 to make room for a future attraction . Speculation arose in the same month that an expansion would feature the Hogwarts Express to connect Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure and Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida . Theme park enthusiasts discovered in June 2012 that the resort had submitted applications for permits to the South Florida Water Management District and the City of Orlando , indicating that it was planning to build a track connecting the two theme parks , as well as one station building in each park . WESH , a local news channel , reported almost a year later that an elevated track system had risen at Universal Orlando and that the track ran between Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure and a construction area in Universal Studios Florida ; confirming the rumours .",
      "Outcome3": "After the success of the Hogsmeade attraction , Universal Orlando explored the possibility of expanding The Wizarding World of Harry Potter to include Diagon Alley and the Hogwarts Express . The expansion was confirmed in 2013 and involved building a track system between the two theme parks and recreating the iconic train from the films . The Hogwarts Express opened in 2014 and quickly became a popular attraction for Harry Potter fans .",
      "Outcome4": "Early in 2011 , rumours spread that Universal Orlando would expand The Wizarding World of Harry Potter after surveying and questioning visitors . The resort confirmed that the Jaws ride would close for a new attraction in December 2011 . Speculation grew that the expansion would feature the Hogwarts Express linking Hogsmeade in Islands of Adventure and Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida . In June 2012 , permit applications revealed plans for a track and stations between the two parks . In June 2013 , WESH reported that an elevated track system had been built . A month later , Universal Orlando announced the Diagon Alley expansion and the Hogwarts Express attraction . By August 2013 , all train parts had arrived and were assembled by October . In January 2014 , the resort showed the interior of the train online . In December 2013 and March 2014 , testing and previews of the ride were spotted and released . The attraction opened on 24 June 2014 for soft opening and on 8 July 2014 for official opening . Within a month , it had one million riders . The development took about two and a half years .",
      "Outcome5": "Some people who liked Harry Potter wanted to see more of his world. They saw a place where he went to school, but they also wanted to see a place where he bought his things. The people who made the places for them to see thought it would be fun to let them ride on the same train that Harry rode on. So they made another place that looked like where Harry bought his things, and they made a train that looked like his train. They put the train between the two places, so people could go from one place to the other like Harry did. They worked very hard to make the train and the places look real and magical.",
      "Outcome6": "Soon after the opening of the Hogsmeade attraction at the Islands of Adventure theme park in 2010 , Universal Orlando Resort started to explore the possibility of expanding The Wizarding World of Harry Potter to another location . Mark Woodbury , the president of Universal Creative , came up with the idea of creating a Hogwarts Express-related attraction that would link the two Harry Potter-themed lands . However, the creative team faced a challenge in deciding where to place Diagon Alley , the second Harry Potter-themed land . Initially, they thought about putting it within Islands of Adventure , but they realized that it would not make sense to have the London and Hogsmeade environments visible to each other . Therefore, they opted for building Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida , which would allow them to recreate the London facade and hide it from Hogsmeade . This also meant that they could use the Hogwarts Express train as a transportation system between the two parks , as well as an immersive experience for guests . The resort began working on this ambitious project in secret , while also surveying visitors about their interest in a potential expansion .",

Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.",

In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.",
      "Passage": "Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards."

However, this view seems to overlook the fact that a student's performance does not solely depend on whether he has a good teacher, but also on his own effort and motivation. Hiring a famous teacher would be of little benefit to those who are lazy and indifferent.",
      "Outcome2": "Admittedly, on the other hand, some people might argue that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can teach their students well. However, I think this argument is not very convincing for two reasons. First, hiring prestigious teachers does not guarantee that they can adapt to the school's curriculum and culture. They might have different teaching styles or expectations that do not suit the students' needs or interests. Second, hiring prestigious teachers does not address the physical and emotional well-being of the students. They might still face problems such as overcrowded classrooms, outdated equipment, or lack of extracurricular opportunities. Therefore, I doubt the effectiveness of hiring prestigious teachers compared to improving facilities.",
      "Outcome3": "Some might argue that schools should spend money on hiring renowned teachers because they can instruct their students well. However, based on my limited understanding, I question the validity of that claim due to its recklessness. A student's performance does not rely on whether he has a good teacher but is determined by his effort on study. It is futile to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who act as idlers.",
      "Outcome4": "Some may argue that hiring prestigious teachers is better for students' learning. But I question this claim because it is not prudent. A student's success depends more on his own effort than on his teacher's fame. Hiring a famous teacher for lazy students is pointless.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people might say that schools should use their money to get very good teachers who can teach their students well. But I think this is not a good idea because it is not fair. A student can learn well or not because of how hard he works, not because of how good his teacher is. It is not helpful to get a very famous teacher for those who do not want to learn.",
      "Outcome6": "Some people might argue that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can provide better education for their students. However, I do not agree with this view for several reasons. First of all, I think that the quality of education is not solely determined by the teacher's reputation, but also by the student's motivation and interest. A teacher can be very knowledgeable and experienced, but if the student is not willing to learn or does not care about the subject, then the teacher's efforts will be wasted. Secondly, I think that hiring prestigious teachers can be very costly and unrealistic for many schools. There are only a limited number of famous teachers in each field, and they may have high demands and expectations from the schools that want to hire them. Moreover, they may not be able to adapt to different teaching environments and cultures, or to meet the diverse needs and preferences of different students. Therefore, I doubt the feasibility and effectiveness of spending money on hiring prestigious teachers.",

Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working.",

Therefore, they may believe that machines are beneficial for society and should be embraced rather than resisted.",

One of the main disadvantages is that machines can cause unemployment and social problems for many workers.

This can make people unhappy and angry. Also, machines use a lot of water and power to work, and this can make our earth very dirty and tired. For example, when we wash dishes by hand, we only use a little water and no power. But when we use a machine to wash dishes, we need a lot of water and power.

For saying this much I have been called an atheist , a term that has no meaning \" . EVR Periyar a born Hindu was vehemently opposed to Hinduism and Christianity . He did not criticize Islam .\n Anita Diehl explains that Periyar was against incompatibility of faith with social equality and not religion itself . In a book on revolution published in 1961 , Periyar stated , \" be of help to people . Do not use treachery or deceit . Speak the truth and do not cheat . That indeed is service to God \" .\n On Hinduism , Periyar believed that it was a religion with no distinctive sacred book ( <unk> gita ) , or origins , but to be an imaginary faith preaching the \" superiority \" of the Brahmins , the inferiority of the Shudras , and the untouchability of the Dalits ( <unk> ) . Maria Misra , a lecturer at Oxford University , compares him to the philosophes , by stating , \" his contemptuous attitude to the baleful influence of Hinduism in Indian public life is strikingly akin to the anti-Catholic diatribes of the enlightenment philosophes \" . In 1955 , Periyar was arrested for his public agitation of burning the pictures of Rama at public places , as a symbolic protest against the Indo-Aryan domination and degradation of the Dravidian leadership according to the Ramayana epic . Periyar also shoed the images of Krishna and Rama , stating that they were Aryan gods that considered the Dravidian Shudras to be \" sons of prostitutes \" .\n Periyar openly suggested to those who were marginalised within the Hindu communities to consider converting to other faiths such as Islam , Christianity , or Buddhism . On Islam , he stated how it was good for abolishing the disgrace in human relationship , based on one of his speeches to railway employees at Tiruchirapalli in 1947 . Periyar also commended Islam for its belief in one invisible and formless God ; proclamation of equal rights for men and women ; and advocating of social unity .",
      "Right": "Apart from Islam and Christianity , Periyar also found in Buddhism a basis for his philosophy though he did not accept that religion . It was again an alternative in the search for self-respect and the object was to get liberation from the discrimination of Hinduism . Through Periyar 's movement Temple Entry Acts of 1924 , 1931 , and up to 1950 were created for the non-Brahmins . Another accomplishment took place during the 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the Temple language in Tamil Nadu , while Dalits were finally eligible for priesthood .",
      "Passage": "At the rally in Tiruchi , Periyar said : \n \" Muslims are following the ancient philosophies of the Dravidians . The Arabic word for Dravidian religion is Islam . When Brahmanism was imposed in this country , it was Mohammad Nabi who opposed it , by instilling the Dravidian religion 's policies as Islam in the minds of the people \" \n Periyar viewed Christianity similar to the monotheistic faith of Islam . He explained that their faith says that there can be only one God which has no name or shape . Periyar took an interest in Rev. Martin Luther , where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European reformer . Thus , Christian views such as that of Ram Mohan Roy 's The Precepts of Jesus has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar ."

      "Left": "The assignment statement ( token ' = ' , the equals sign ) . This operates differently than in traditional imperative programming languages , and this fundamental mechanism ( including the nature of Python 's version of variables ) illuminates many other features of the language . Assignment in C , e.g. , x \n = 2 , translates to \" typed variable name x receives a copy of numeric value 2 \" . The ( right-hand ) value is copied into an allocated storage location for which the ( left-hand ) variable name is the symbolic address . The memory allocated to the variable is large enough ( potentially quite large ) for the declared type . In the simplest case of Python assignment , using the same example , x = \n 2 , translates to \" ( generic ) name x receives a reference to a separate , dynamically allocated object of numeric ( int ) type of value 2 . \" This is termed binding the name to the object . Since the name 's storage location doesn 't contain the indicated value , it is improper to call it a variable . Names may be subsequently rebound at any time to objects of greatly varying types , including strings , procedures , complex objects with data and methods , etc . Successive assignments of a common value to multiple names , e.g. , x \n = 2 ; y = \n 2 ; z = 2 result in allocating storage to ( at most ) three names and one numeric object , to which all three names are bound . Since a name is a generic reference holder it is unreasonable to associate a fixed data type with it . However at a given time a name will be bound to some object , which will have a type ; thus there is dynamic typing .\n The if statement , which conditionally executes a block of code , along with else and <unk> ( a contraction of else-if ) .\n The for statement , which iterates over an <unk> object , capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block .\n The while statement , which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true .\n The try statement , which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses ; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits .\n The class statement , which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class , for use in object-oriented programming .\n The def statement , which defines a function or method .",

A context manager is an object that can perform some actions before and after the code block , such as acquiring and releasing a lock , or opening and closing a file . This allows for a concise and safe way to handle resources that need to be cleaned up or released after use , following the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization ( RAII ) pattern . However , the with statement also has some limitations , such as not being able to handle multiple exit points from the code block , or not being able to access the context manager 's attributes outside the block . Additionally , writing custom context managers requires implementing special methods ( __enter__ and __exit__ ) that may not be intuitive for some programmers .",
      "Outcome2": "Another statement that is useful in Python is the with statement. It lets you run some code and then do something else automatically, like cleaning up or closing a file. You can think of it as a way of managing your resources more easily. For example, if you want to use a lock to protect some data from being accessed by other threads, you can use the with statement to make sure the lock is acquired before you use the data and released after you are done.",
      "Outcome3": "Some possible ways to rewrite the text using bullet points instead of commas are:\n\n- The with statement ( from Python 2.5 ) , which encloses a code block within a context manager , allowing Resource Acquisition Is <unk> ( <unk> ) -like behavior .

      "Outcome5": "Some things in Python help you do stuff with other things. For example, the with thing lets you use something and then put it away when you are done, like a toy or a book. You don't have to worry about cleaning up or closing anything, because the with thing does it for you.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the features introduced in Python 2.5 is the with statement, which allows a programmer to specify a context in which a block of code will be executed. A context manager is an object that defines what actions to take before and after the execution of the code block, such as acquiring and releasing a resource, or opening and closing a file. By using the with statement, the programmer can ensure that these actions are always performed, even if the code block raises an exception or returns early. The with statement simplifies the code and reduces the possibility of errors or leaks.",

Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies.

According to a study by the National Center for Education Statistics, students who delayed their enrollment in postsecondary education for more than one year after high school had lower completion rates than those who enrolled immediately or within one year. Moreover, working or traveling during a break can expose students to some unhealthy habits or temptations, such as smoking or drinking. But, the break should not be a mandatory requirement. It depends on the individual preferences and goals of each student, how they use that time. A break can offer valuable opportunities for personal and professional growth if planned wisely.",
      "Outcome2": "However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, they may become satisfied with their income and lose their motivation to pursue higher education. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably.

For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably.

It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.",
      "Outcome4": "Yet, a break also has drawbacks. It can make students lose focus and harm their performance. Working during the break can create a false sense of satisfaction with low-paying jobs. For example, my cousin worked in a call centre after high school and got sidetracked. He failed his university courses later. Students can also pick up bad habits like smoking or drinking. But, the break should depend on the individual and how they use it. A break can benefit students more than harm them.",
      "Outcome5": "But, there are some bad things too. A break can make you forget what you learned in school and make it hard to study again. When you work and get money, you might think that is enough and not want to learn more. For example, my cousin worked in a place where he talked to people on the phone after school and he lost interest in studying. When he went to college, he did not do well. You might also do some things that are not good for you, like smoking or drinking, during this time. But, the break is up to you. Different people do different things with their time. A break can help you more than hurt you.",
      "Outcome6": "However, taking a break after high school is not without its drawbacks. One possible disadvantage is that a break can disrupt the academic momentum of students and affect their performance. For example, when students get used to working and earning money during their break, they may lose sight of their educational goals and become complacent. This happened to my cousin who worked in a customer care centre after high school and got sidetracked. When he resumed his university studies, he struggled to cope with the coursework and failed badly. Another potential risk is that students may develop bad habits or behaviors during their break, such as smoking or drinking. Therefore, taking a break should not be a mandatory requirement for all students. It depends on the individual circumstances and preferences of each student, as well as how they use their time wisely. A well-planned and productive break can bring more benefits than harms to students.",

All of these things operating in synchronicity : like ringtones , flat-screens , theater , cuisine , fashion , sushi . I don 't want to call it \" virtual reality , \" so I call it Far Side Virtual . If you really want to understand Far Side , first off , listen to [ Claude ] Debussy , and secondly , go into a frozen yogurt shop . Afterwards , go into an Apple store and just fool around , hang out in there . Afterwards , go to Starbucks and get a gift card . They have a book there on the history of Starbucks — buy this book and go home . If you do all these things you 'll understand what Far Side Virtual is — because people kind of live in it already .",

Each track is bristling with the maximalist promise of a world of possibilities waiting behind the screen for your double-click , and evokes a time when we were much less familiar with and cynical about the virtual world technology has brought us into . \" Bomb writer Luke Degnan wrote , \" This is what Far Side Virtual does for 45 minutes — it reminds the listener that these sounds were born digitally and will die digitally . This is a digital album for a digital age . \" \n  Ferraro said , \" When I made Far Side Virtual , I was really into grime . I lived in Leeds for a year and I used to hear to kids listening to instrumentals on their phones , rapping over the top . I love the way that sounds : the texture of super compressed digital beats coming out of a cellphone and just a voice over it . Far Side Virtual was inspired by hearing music like that . \" Electronic musician Dan Deacon praised the album for its unaltered , standard MIDI sound . Commenting on the production style , Joseph Stannard of The Wire wrote , \" In contrast to the audio soup of Ferraro 's earlier recordings , these tracks have a spacious , architectural feel that recalls Laurie Anderson , Philip Glass and Rush . \" \n  Critics noted that the album abandons the veneer of noise that coats Ferraro 's previous releases while retaining — and reimagining — the form and ethos of noise music . Ferraro said \" it 's still in the tradition of noise . \" According to Bomb magazine writer Luke Degan , the album is unlike the \" reverbed-out , feedback-laden noise music \" of Ferraro 's earlier music , but instead represents the noise of the \" digital age . \" A Fact writer said , \" there 's no distortion , no tape-hiss , no obvious underground signifiers ... [ but ] this new cleanness and clarity to the Ferraro aesthetic hasn 't diminished the hallucinatory power of his music ...",

Ferraro created Far Side Virtual with the Apple audio software GarageBand , which brought out the \" cheap digital sound \" he desired , and called it a \" [ r ] <unk> plastic symphony for global warming , dedicated to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch . This is ringtone music meant to be experienced on the post-structuralist medium , the smartphone . \" Ferraro frequently described it as a still life of the 21st century . Far Side Virtual was retrospectively tagged as one of the first , and most influential , releases in vaporwave , a genre mostly spread via the Internet and identified by its adoption of dated electronic \" corporate mood music \" and ambiguously ironic attitude ."

      "Outcome5": "Some of the sounds on the album are things you hear every day when you use a computer or a phone, like the sound when Skype starts or when Windows turns off. Ferraro used a program called GarageBand to make the music, and he wanted it to sound like cheap and simple digital music. He said his music is about how the world is getting warmer and there is a lot of trash in the ocean. He also said his music is like a picture of how people live now with all these gadgets and machines. Some people call this kind of music vaporwave, which is a funny name for music that uses old and boring electronic sounds and makes fun of them.",

He said that this was ringtone music that was meant to be experienced on the post-structuralist medium of the smartphone, which reflects the fragmented and mediated nature of contemporary reality. Ferraro often referred to his album as a still life of the 21st century, capturing the essence and atmosphere of a digitalized society. The album was later recognized as one of the first and most influential examples of vaporwave, a genre that emerged online and that appropriated and subverted the aesthetics of outdated electronic \"corporate mood music\" with an ambiguous ironic stance.",

Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the \"weaker\" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.",
      "Right": "Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.",
      "Passage": "In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration."

      "Outcome1": "Furthermore, the fairness between males and females is reflected in the remarkable achievements of women in various domains. Women are no longer confined to tedious domestic chores and child-rearing. They can be successful entrepreneurs, politicians, scientists and so on. This shows that the so-called \"weaker\" gender has equal rights and abilities to contribute to the advancement of humanity as men do, and sometimes they even excel in certain areas.",
      "Outcome2": "Secondly, the revolution in female rights has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but to society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wife and the husband working to earn money. What is more, women have an outstanding instinct for some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and attention to detail.",
      "Outcome3": "Another reason to support the fairness between males and females is the positive impact that the revolution in females' right has on both themselves and society. For example, the financial burden of families has been reduced significantly with both spouses working to earn money. Moreover, women have a natural advantage in some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.",
      "Outcome4": "Furthermore, the rise of women's rights has positive impacts on both themselves and society. For example, families can share the financial pressure with both spouses working. Also, women excel at some jobs like healthcare or human resource management because of their patience and elaboration.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people think that girls and boys can do different things. But this is not true. Girls and boys can do the same things if they want to. They can learn, work, play, and help other people. Sometimes girls are better at some things than boys, and sometimes boys are better at some things than girls. But they are both important and good.\n\nWhen girls and boys both work, they can have more money for their families. They can also do some jobs that make other people happy or healthy. For example, some girls like to be nurses or teachers because they are good at caring for others. Some boys like to be doctors or engineers because they are good at solving problems.",
      "Outcome6": "Another important reason why the fairness between males and females is indispensable in such a developed society is that the advancement of women's rights has brought about many positive impacts not only to themselves but society as well. For example, the financial burden of families has been alleviated significantly with both the spouses working to earn income and sharing the household responsibilities. Moreover, women have the innate qualities to excel in some professions like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience, compassion and attention to detail.",

These facilities are accredited to deliver vocational training within an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health context to registrars enrolled in the Australian General Practice Training (AGPT) program.\n An Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service (ACCHS) or an Aboriginal Medical Service (AMS) is a primary health care service initiated and operated by the local Aboriginal community to deliver holistic, comprehensive, and culturally appropriate health care to the community which controls it (through a locally elected Board of Management).\n The term ACCHS is used throughout this brochure in reference to both ACCHSs and AMSs.\n Please note: Some State and Territory owned primary health care facilities, which provide health care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, are also accredited as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health training posts.\n General practice\nWhere the term 'general practice' is used in this brochure it is, where context permits, deemed to include rural and remote medicine.\n General Practice Education and Training Limited (GPET) manages and funds the Australian General Practice Training (AGPT) program. GPET is a wholly owned government company, set up by the Australian Government in 2001 to establish and administer a regionalised approach to training, which is now delivered by 17 regional training providers (RTPs) across Australia.\n The Australian General Practice Training (AGPT) program is an Australian Government initiative.

I really enjoyed the work. You have the best of many worlds. You manage serious, interesting and overlapping conditions like a general physician, but still deal with vital young patients with families and children.\n Warren undertook his post part-time over 12 months in conjunction with an academic post during his extended skills training.\n Where do you undertake a post?\nPosts can be undertaken in metropolitan, regional, rural and remote areas all over Australia.",

The journey of healing can be that of a physical, emotional or spiritual nature, and each healing process we begin is equally important as the next.\nOur journey often begins at a very personal level and as the healing builds momentum, others are included and affected by our changes and this creates a ripple effect that then influences others around us, such as our families and communities.\nMany people cross our paths during our journey, but do not deter us from the path of wellbeing in which we have chosen to walk.\nAs we travel our journey upwards, we become less dependent on others and learn to look within our strength and courage to support us in our journey of healing and wellbeing.\nGPET acknowledges the review and endorsement of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO)."

Some of the benefits of undertaking a post include:\n\n- Developing clinical expertise in treating conditions that are more prevalent or severe among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, rheumatic fever and ear infections. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), these conditions account for 70% of the health gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\n- Working as part of a multidisciplinary team that includes Aboriginal health workers, nurses, allied health professionals, social workers and community elders. You will learn how to collaborate effectively and respectfully with different health care providers and how to utilise their skills and knowledge to improve patient outcomes.\n- Understanding cultural protocols and communicating complex health issues in a culturally safe and appropriate manner. You will learn how to build rapport and trust with your patients, how to acknowledge their history, values and beliefs, and how to address the social determinants of health that affect their wellbeing.\n- Focusing on population and public health approaches that aim to prevent illness, promote wellness and empower communities. You will learn how to implement evidence-based interventions that are tailored to the local context and needs of your patients, such as screening programs, immunisation campaigns, chronic disease management plans and health education activities.\n- Health promotion within a cultural context. You will learn how to incorporate traditional knowledge, practices and perspectives into your health promotion strategies, such as using art, storytelling, music or dance to convey health messages or engage community members.",

The journey of learning and growth can be physical, emotional or spiritual, or all three at once.\nYour journey often starts at a personal level, but as you progress, you will also impact others around you, such as your patients, colleagues and communities. You will create a ripple effect of positive change that will influence the health outcomes of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.\nMany people will cross your path during your journey, but they will not distract you from the goal of providing quality primary health care in a culturally appropriate way.\nAs you travel your journey upwards, you will become more confident and independent as a GP, but also more aware of your own strengths and limitations. You will learn to look within yourself for courage and support, but also to seek help when needed.\nGPET acknowledges the review and endorsement of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO).",

      "Outcome5": "Imagine you have a big boo-boo on your arm or leg. It hurts and you want it to go away. Sometimes you need a special doctor to help you heal your boo-boo. The special doctor knows how to make you feel better and give you medicine or a band-aid. The special doctor also knows how to talk to you nicely and understand your feelings. Sometimes the special doctor works in a place where other people who have boo-boos like yours live. They are like your friends who can help you too. You can learn from them and play with them while you get better.\nThe picture shows how the special doctor helps you and your friends heal your boo-boos. You start at the bottom of the picture, where you need a lot of help from the special doctor and your friends. As you go up the picture, you need less help because your boo-boo is getting smaller and smaller. You also learn how to take care of yourself and be strong and brave. When you reach the top of the picture, your boo-boo is gone and you are happy and healthy.",
      "Outcome6": "One way to visualise the process of healing is to imagine a journey that we choose to embark on when we decide to address a health issue that affects us physically, emotionally or spiritually. Each of these dimensions of health is equally important and deserves our attention and care. Healing is not only a personal matter, but also a social one, as it impacts our relationships with others and our sense of belonging to a community. As we progress on our healing journey, we may inspire and influence others who are also seeking wellbeing and harmony in their lives.\n\nOur journey may take us through different paths and terrains, but we should not lose sight of our goal of achieving better health and happiness. Along the way, we may encounter many people who offer us support, guidance or companionship, but ultimately we are responsible for our own choices and actions. We need to rely on our inner strength and courage to overcome the challenges and obstacles that we may face.\n\nAs we climb higher on our journey, we become more self-reliant and confident in our abilities to cope with different situations and environments. We learn to trust ourselves and listen to our intuition. We also develop a deeper understanding of ourselves and others, as well as a greater appreciation of the diversity and richness of cultures.\n\nGPET acknowledges the review and endorsement of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (NACCHO).",

      "Left": "MacArthur's own force suffered heavy casualties when he recklessly wasted troops to seize Buna and Gona, but it did, by December 1942, end the Japanese threat to Australia. In March 1943, MacArthur's air chief, Gen. George Kenney, successfully organized his planes in a spectacular attack on a Japanese reinforcing convoy of ships. After the bombers sank the troop transports and a few destroyers, American fighter planes and patrol boats strafed and machine-gunned the floating survivors in a veritable war crime. Such was the mercilessness of the Pacific war. Then, in April 1943, when the \"Magic\" code showed that Adm. Yamamoto intended to fly in and visit his troops at the front, U.S. Navy flyers intercepted his airplane, sending the admiral to a warrior's death. '\n For the rest of the war, U.S. Marines and soldiers \"hopped\" from one island to the next, suffering horrific casualties whenever they needed to seize, and not bypass, a stronghold. Early on, U.S. commanders began to worry about the potential catastrophe of invading Japan itself, since with each step to the home islands the defenders fought even more tenaciously. That attrition rate was simply unsustainable for the Americans. The resolve of the Japanese soldiers was demonstrated on island after island. Almost none became prisoners, partly because U.S. troops decided to stop taking any, but mainly because to surrender was to the Japanese the ultimate dishonor. '\n So it was that Nimitz drove straight west across the Central Pacific and MacArthur \"hopped\" to the northeast of Australia. When Nimitz's troops reached the island of Saipan, the final 3,000 desperate Japanese defenders, some wielding only knives tied to bamboo poles, suicidally rushed the American lines screaming the battle cry \"Banzai!\" They were wiped out. Then on Marpi Point, at the northern tip of the island, Japanese women and children leaped to their deaths off the 250-foot cliffs. The horrified American interpreters shouted through bullhorns in an attempt to coax at least some to choose surrender over suicide. Still, thousands jumped, and when the battle finally ended, the Americans had suffered an additional 14,000 casualties. '",
      "Right": "The war had permanently turned against the Japanese by late 1944. The issue was settled, and only the final casualty counts were in question. U.S. submarines cut Japanese oil and other supplies to a trickle. Japan was in danger of being starved. Then, in the epic Battle of Leyte",
      "Passage": "When Nimitz and members of the president's staff suggested that it was perhaps best to bypass the well-defended Philippines, MacArthur loudly objected. Should their Filipino \"wards\" not be liberated, MacArthur boldly warned FDR, \"I dare say that the American people would be so aroused that they would register most complete resentment against you at the polls this fall.\" Only a man like MacArthur would dare serve up such an overt political threat. Nonetheless, the president made another \"non-decision\"; both Nimitz and MacArthur would drive forward as planned and the Philippines remained on the target list. '"

      "Outcome1": "However, MacArthur's personal ambition and sense of duty would not allow him to bypass the Philippines, where he had made his famous vow to return. He argued vehemently with Nimitz and Roosevelt that the liberation of the Filipinos was a moral imperative and a political necessity. He even implied that Roosevelt's re-election might depend on it. Faced with such pressure, Roosevelt gave in to MacArthur's demand and authorized the invasion of the Philippines. '",
      "Outcome2": "When Nimitz and members of the president's staff suggested that it was perhaps best to bypass the well-defended Philippines, MacArthur loudly objected. He insisted that the Filipinos deserved to be freed from Japanese occupation, and he also implied that FDR's reelection chances would be hurt if he abandoned them. According to historian Ian Toll, MacArthur bluntly told the president, \"I dare say that the American people would be so aroused that they would register most complete resentment against you at the polls this fall.\" Such a brazen political ultimatum was typical of MacArthur's arrogance and ambition. Nonetheless, the president made another \"non-decision\"; both Nimitz and MacArthur would drive forward as planned and the Philippines remained on the target list. '",
      "Outcome3": "MacArthur insisted that the Philippines must be liberated, despite the advice of Nimitz and some of FDR's staff to bypass the heavily fortified islands. He warned FDR that abandoning their Filipino allies would cost him the election. The president did not overrule MacArthur, and both commanders continued their advance as planned. '",
      "Outcome4": "MacArthur insisted on liberating the Philippines, despite Nimitz and others advising to bypass them. He threatened FDR with political backlash if he ignored the Filipinos. The president let both commanders proceed as they wished and kept the Philippines as a target. '",
      "Outcome5": "Mr. Nimitz and Mr. MacArthur were both trying to get to Japan, but they had different ways of doing it. Mr. Nimitz wanted to go straight to the islands that were close to Japan, and Mr. MacArthur wanted to go back to the Philippines, where he had friends who needed help. Some people thought that going back to the Philippines was too hard and not needed, but Mr. MacArthur said that if they didn't do it, the people who chose the president would be very angry at him. The president didn't want to make anyone angry, so he let both Mr. Nimitz and Mr. MacArthur do what they wanted.",
      "Outcome6": "However, Nimitz faced some opposition when he and some of the president's advisers proposed to skip the heavily fortified Philippines and focus on other strategic islands. MacArthur strongly disagreed with this plan and argued that the U.S. had a moral obligation to liberate the Filipinos from Japanese occupation. He also warned FDR that if he abandoned the Philippines, he would face a severe backlash from the American public in the upcoming election. MacArthur's words were a clear challenge to the president's authority, but FDR did not want to provoke a confrontation with his popular general. He decided to let both Nimitz and MacArthur continue their respective campaigns and keep the Philippines as a target. '",

      "Left": "Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.",
      "Right": "To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.",
      "Passage": "Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time."

Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the main arguments against spending less time in cooking food is that it would compromise the nutrition and quality of food for the family. However, this argument is not convincing, because technology and regulations have made it possible to have healthy and safe food without spending too much time in the kitchen. For example, ozone machines can eliminate harmful substances from vegetables, fruits and foods, and restaurants have to follow strict standards of quality and hygiene. Therefore, people can enjoy a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, without wasting a lot of time.",
      "Outcome3": "However, some people may hold a different view. They believe that cooking food at home ensures the nutrition and quality of their family's meals. This argument has some merit. Nevertheless, it does not mean that using technology or advanced facilities to prepare food will compromise its nutrition and quality. On the contrary, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods can be eliminated, thus enhancing the health and safety of eaters. Moreover, as the living standard rises, most restaurants are required to meet strict standards of quality control and supervision by relevant authorities. Therefore, it is quite possible to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality without spending too much time.",
      "Outcome4": "Some people may disagree and say that cooking food at home ensures its nutrition and quality. This is partly true, but technology and facilities can also preserve or enhance food's value. For example, ozone machines can eliminate harmful substances from vegetables, fruits and foods. Moreover, most restaurants have to follow strict standards of quality and hygiene by the authorities. Therefore, having a meal at a restaurant can save time and still be nutritious and safe.",
      "Outcome5": "Some people may say that making your own food is good for you and your family. They are right in some ways. But, sometimes, using machines or tools can also make good food. They can help you clean the bad things from the food and keep the good things. Also, many places where you can buy food are very careful to make sure their food is good for you. So, you can have good food without spending a lot of time.",
      "Outcome6": "However, some people may hold a different opinion. They may claim that cooking food by themselves can ensure the nutrition and quality of their food, which is beneficial for their health and well-being. This argument has some merit, but it is not convincing enough. Firstly, cooking food does not necessarily mean that the food is more nutritious and healthy than the food from restaurants. Nowadays, there are many technological devices and advanced facilities that can help people preserve and process food without losing its nutrition and quality. For example, using ozone machines can eliminate or reduce the harmful substances such as bacteria, mold spores, or pesticide residues in vegetables, fruits and foods. Secondly, eating at restaurants does not mean that the food is less nutritious and healthy than the food cooked at home. With the improvement of living standards and social awareness, many restaurants have to follow strict regulations and standards to ensure the quality and safety of their products. Therefore, it is not difficult to find a restaurant that can provide a balanced and nutritious meal for customers.",

      "Left": "By January 1956 the author Ian Fleming had published three novels — Casino Royale in 1953 , Live and Let Die in 1954 and Moonraker in 1955 . A fourth , Diamonds Are Forever , was being edited and prepared for production . That month Fleming travelled to his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica to write From Russia , with Love . He followed his usual practice , which he later outlined in Books and Bookmen magazine : \" I write for about three hours in the morning ... and I do another hour 's work between six and seven in the evening . I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written ... By following my formula , you write 2,000 words a day . \" He returned to London in March that year with a 228-page first-draft manuscript that he subsequently altered more heavily than any of his other works . One of the significant re-writes changed Bond 's fate ; Fleming had become disenchanted with his books and wrote to his friend , the American author Raymond Chandler : \" My muse is in a very bad way ... I am getting fed up with Bond and it has been very difficult to make him go through his tawdry tricks . \" Fleming re-wrote the end of the novel in April 1956 to make Klebb poison Bond , which allowed him to finish the series with the death of the character if he wanted . Fleming 's first draft ended with Bond and Romanova enjoying a romance . By January 1957 Fleming had decided he would write another story , and began work on Dr. No in which Bond recovers from his poisoning and is sent to Jamaica .\n Fleming 's trip to Istanbul in June 1955 to cover an Interpol conference for The Sunday Times was a source of much of the background information in the story . While there he met the Oxford-educated ship owner Nazim Kalkavan , who became the model for Darko Kerim ; Fleming took down many of Kalkavan 's conversations in a notebook , and used them verbatim in the novel .",
      "Right": "In August 1956 , for fifty guineas , Fleming commissioned Richard Chopping to provide the art for the cover , based on Fleming 's design ; the result won a number of prizes . After Diamonds Are Forever had been published in March 1956 , Fleming received a letter from a thirty-one-year-old Bond enthusiast and gun expert , Geoffrey Boothroyd , criticising the author 's choice of firearm for Bond . Boothroyd 's suggestions came too late to be included in From Russia , with Love , but one of his guns — a .38 Smith & Wesson snub-nosed revolver modified with one third of the trigger guard removed — was used as the model for Chopping 's image . Fleming later thanked Boothroyd by naming the armourer in Dr. No Major Boothroyd .",
      "Passage": "Although Fleming did not date the event within his novels , John Griswold and Henry Chancellor — both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications — have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole . Chancellor put the events of From Russia , with Love in 1955 ; Griswold is more precise , and considers the story to have taken place between June and August 1954 ."

      "Outcome2": "Although Fleming did not date the event within his novels , John Griswold and Henry Chancellor — both of whom wrote books for Ian Fleming Publications — have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole . According to Griswold's analysis in Ian Fleming's James Bond: Annotations and Chronologies for Ian Fleming's Bond Stories (2006), the story took place between June and August 1954 . Chancellor, on the other hand, placed the events of From Russia , with Love in 1955 in his book James Bond: The Man and His World (2005), which explored the historical and cultural context of Fleming's novels .",
      "Outcome3": "From Russia , with Love has no specific date in Fleming 's novels , but John Griswold and Henry Chancellor — both authors of books for Ian Fleming Publications — have established different timelines based on the events and situations in the novel series . Chancellor set the events of From Russia , with Love in 1955 ; Griswold gave a more precise timeframe , and placed the story between June and August 1954 .",
      "Outcome4": "Based on the novel series, John Griswold and Henry Chancellor — authors for Ian Fleming Publications — dated the events of From Russia , with Love differently . Chancellor set them in 1955 ; Griswold narrowed it down to June-August 1954 .",
      "Outcome5": "Some people write books about a man named Bond who goes on adventures. One of these people was Ian Fleming. He wrote a book called From Russia, with Love. He did not know when the story happened, but some other people tried to guess. They looked at the things that happened in the book and in other books about Bond. They said the story might have happened in 1954 or 1955.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the challenges of writing a series of novels is to establish a consistent timeline for the events and characters . Fleming did not explicitly date his stories , leaving room for speculation and interpretation by his readers and later writers . Two authors who have written official Bond novels for Ian Fleming Publications , John Griswold and Henry Chancellor , have attempted to reconstruct a chronological order for the original Fleming novels based on clues and references within the texts . However , their results differ in some details . Chancellor places the events of From Russia , with Love in 1955 , the same year that Fleming travelled to Istanbul and gathered much of the background information for the story . Griswold , on the other hand , offers a more precise estimate , and argues that the story takes place between June and August 1954 , based on factors such as weather conditions , historical events and cultural references .",

Canonicus had a tonnage of 1,034 tons burthen and displaced 2,100 long tons ( 2,100 t ) .

The 320-indicated-horsepower ( 240 kW ) engine gave the ship a top speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ; 9.2 mph ) . She carried 140 – 150 long tons ( 140 – 150 t ) of coal . Canonicus 's main armament consisted of two smoothbore , muzzle-loading , 15-inch ( 381 mm ) Dahlgren guns mounted in a single gun turret . Each gun weighed approximately 43,000 pounds ( 20,000 kg ) . They could fire a 350-pound ( 158.8 kg ) shell up to a range of 2,100 yards ( 1,900 m ) at an elevation of + 7 ° .",

She was launched on 1 August 1863 and commissioned on 16 April 1864 with Commander E. G. Parrott in command . The ship 's construction was delayed by multiple changes ordered while she was being built that reflected battle experience with earlier monitors . This included the rebuilding of the turrets and pilot houses to increase their armor thickness from 8 inches ( 203 mm ) to 10 inches and to replace the bolts that secured their armor plates together with rivets to prevent them from being knocked loose by the shock of impact from shells striking the turret . Other changes included deepening the hull by 18 inches ( 457 mm ) to increase the ship 's buoyancy , moving the position of the turret to balance the ship 's trim and replacing all of the ship 's deck armor . As far as is known the ship was not modified after her completion .",

A 5-by-15-inch ( 130 by 380 mm ) soft iron band was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent shells and fragments from jamming the turret as had happened during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863 . The base of the funnel was protected to a height of 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) by 8 inches ( 200 mm ) of armor . A \" rifle screen \" of 1 ⁄ 2-inch ( 13 mm ) armor 3 feet ( 0.9 m ) high was installed on the top of the turret to protect the crew against Confederate snipers based on a suggestion by Commander Tunis A. M. Craven , captain of her sister ship Tecumseh ."

      "Outcome3": "Canonicus was a heavily armored ironclad monitor with a single turret that mounted two 15-inch guns. She had a steam engine that propelled her at a speed of 8 knots and carried enough coal for long-range operations. She was designed to withstand enemy fire with five layers of iron plates on her hull, ten layers on her turret and pilot house, and additional protection for her funnel, turret base, and turret top.",
      "Outcome4": "Her hull sides had five layers of 1-inch ( 25 mm ) iron plates over wood . The turret and pilot house had ten layers of the same plates . The deck armor was 1.5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick . A soft iron band around the turret base and a \" rifle screen \" on top protected the crew from enemy fire . These features were based on previous combat experience with monitors .",
      "Outcome5": "Some parts of the ship were very strong because they had many layers of metal and wood on them. The metal and wood were like a shell that kept the ship safe from other ships that wanted to hurt it. The ship had a big round thing on top that could turn around. Inside the round thing, there were two very big guns that could shoot far away. The guns were so big that they needed many people to move them and load them. The ship also had a place where the captain could see where he was going and tell the other people what to do. The captain's place and the round thing had more metal on them than the rest of the ship, because they were very important. The ship also had a tall pipe that let out smoke from the fire that made the ship move. The pipe had some metal around it too, so it would not break easily. And on top of the round thing, there was a small wall of metal that was not very thick. The wall was there to stop people from shooting at the people inside the round thing with small guns.",
      "Outcome6": "Canonicus had a hull that was covered by five layers of wrought iron plates, each one inch thick, on the sides. These plates were supported by wooden backing. The gun turret and the pilot house, where the ship was steered and commanded, had even thicker armor, made of ten layers of one-inch plates. The ship's deck, which was exposed to enemy fire from above, had armor that was 1.5 inches thick. To prevent the turret from getting stuck by shells or debris hitting its base, a band of soft iron that measured 5 inches by 15 inches was attached around it. This was a lesson learned from the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863, when a monitor's turret was jammed by a shell. Another improvement that Canonicus had over earlier monitors was a \"rifle screen\" of half-inch armor that stood 3 feet high on top of the turret. This screen protected the crew from being shot by Confederate snipers who could target them through the gun ports or the ventilation holes. The idea for the screen came from Commander Tunis A. M. Craven, who was in charge of her sister ship Tecumseh.",

      "Left": "In defining this right in its article 1, the Declaration affirmed that \"every person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, social cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized.\n The requirement of participation is one of the four pillars of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.\n The foregoing clarifies that the right to equal participation is based in the overarching customary law character of the prohibition of discrimination on any basis. But prohibition alone is not enough and states are called upon to be vigilant and to take active measures to ensure equality and non-discrimination. This requires that special attention be given to women and to historically marginalized groups and communities in order to ensure their participation and to reduce discrimination at the same time.\n The U.N. Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues elaborated on the right to \"effective participation.\" Persons belonging to ethnic, religious and other minorities, particularly women, must be able to participate not only in political decision-making at both the local and national levels, but also should be given the means to participate effectively in the cultural, religious, social and economic spheres of their societies.\n Participation rights encompass the right to be consulted at each phase of legislative drafting and policymaking, to voice opinions and criticism, and to submit proposals aimed at improving the functioning and inclusivity of all State bodies. Along with the other international treaties and declarations, the declaration on human rights defenders' article 8 reaffirms the right, \"individually and in association with others\" to non-discriminatory participation in the conduct of public affairs, which includes the right to submit to governmental institutions criticisms and \"proposals for improving their functioning and to draw attention to any aspect of their work that may hinder or impede the promotion, protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n In a number of resolutions, the Human Rights Council reaffirmed that a number of related rights were \"among the essential conditions for equal participation in political and public affairs and must be promoted and protected. \"\nIn the best of all possible worlds, full exercise of the right to participation requires an open and democratic society that recognizes the indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights, and where public policies in all spheres are openly discussed and debated, and decision makers are accountable to the people.\n The regional context",
      "Right": "Arguably, it should have therefore come as no surprise that the uprisings for \"freedom, dignity and social justice,\" which shook the region in early 2011 took place in five Arab states that had had no change in government for 30 or more years. While most of the revolts did succeed in toppling their regimes, they have since descended into internal armed conflict with hundreds of thousands of civilians and combatants killed, massive destruction of economies and infrastructure, the impoverishment of millions and the creation of one of the worst refugee crises in contemporary history affecting not only the region but also the international community as a whole.\n Tunisia has seen the only peaceful and successful transition towards a democratic governance system even as it continues to struggle for stability and permanence. It was also the only Arab country to rate a \"partly free\" determination by Freedom House's Freedom in the World index in January 2018, scoring an aggregate 70/100.\n It is difficult to speak of people's right to participate in the conduct of public affairs with such a democracy deficit and in such an environment of conflict, human insecurity and constant shifts and movements yet so little positive change. This study will therefore have to content itself with a more theoretical overview of what the texts of constitutions and what some legislative provisions provide in terms of guarantees and openings, bolstered by more generalized information.\n Since the Arab states gained independence in the late 1940s, most of their constitutions have gone through periodic updates, amendments and revisions but a marked flurry of developments occurred as a result of the 2011 upheavals in the region.\n Whether republics or monarchies, Arab states' constitutions are different from one another in many respects, but markedly similar in others. Most of them in fact include provisions that nominally accept or facilitate citizens' participation in the conduct of public affairs, equality and non-discrimination clauses that vary in detail. They also include chapters on public rights and freedoms that guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms relevant to the exercise of participation.\n Consistent with Article 21(3) of the UDHR, the majority of Arab constitutions affirm that sovereignty and/or authority resides with the people and exercised through elections to representatives, through referendums and as some constitutions reference, through \"constitutional institutions.\n This raises the question of interpretations, which are not necessarily consistent, either in the Arab states or in other Muslim majority countries.",
      "Passage": "In the Arab region, political systems have generally not been conducive to democratic participation. Eight countries are monarchies with hereditary accession of the head of state and in most of those countries, the Monarchy has near absolute decision-making authority."

      "Outcome0": "",
      "Outcome1": "One of the common features of Arab states' constitutions is that they contain provisions that formally recognize or enable citizens' participation in the conduct of public affairs, as well as clauses that prohibit discrimination and affirm human rights and fundamental freedoms related to participation. However, these provisions vary widely in their scope, content and implementation across the region. Some constitutions specify the mechanisms and procedures for popular participation, such as elections, referendums, consultations and petitions, while others are vague or silent on these matters. Some constitutions explicitly guarantee equality and non-discrimination for all citizens regardless of their gender, ethnicity, religion or other status, while others limit these rights to certain groups or subject them to qualifications or exceptions. Some constitutions enshrine a wide range of civil and political rights that are essential for effective participation, such as freedom of expression, assembly, association and information, while others restrict or undermine these rights by imposing conditions or granting broad powers to the executive or judiciary to regulate or curtail them.",
      "Outcome2": "One of the main challenges for democratic participation in the Arab region is the nature of the political systems, which are mostly dominated by monarchies or long-standing regimes. Even though some countries experienced popular uprisings in 2011 that demanded more freedom and justice, most of them have not achieved a peaceful and stable transition to democracy. Tunisia is an exception, as it has made significant progress in establishing a more pluralistic and representative system. Most Arab constitutions contain provisions that recognize the sovereignty of the people and their right to participate in public affairs, but they also vary in their degree of detail and implementation.",
      "Outcome3": "According to the Arab Human Development Report 2016, the popular uprisings that erupted in 2011 in five Arab states were driven by demands for \"freedom, dignity and social justice\" and challenged the authoritarian regimes that had ruled for decades.",
      "Outcome4": "Arab political systems have often lacked democratic participation. The 2011 uprisings, which demanded \"freedom, dignity and social justice,\" toppled some regimes but also triggered violent conflicts and humanitarian crises. Tunisia is the only Arab country that achieved a peaceful and democratic transition, albeit with challenges. It was also the only one rated as \"partly free\" by Freedom House in 2018.",
      "Outcome5": "Some countries in the Arab region are ruled by kings who have a lot of power and do not let people choose their leaders. Some other countries are not ruled by kings, but they also do not let people choose their leaders or change them for a long time. A few years ago, many people in these countries became very unhappy and angry. They wanted to have more freedom and fairness and to have a say in how their countries are run. They went out to the streets and asked for new leaders. In some places, this worked and the old leaders left. But in other places, this made things worse and there was a lot of fighting and violence. Many people died or had to leave their homes and go to other countries. Only one country was able to change its leaders peacefully and become more democratic, which means that people can vote and have different opinions.",
      "Outcome6": "However, the Arab region has generally suffered from a lack of democratic participation in its political systems. Most of the countries are ruled by monarchies that inherit the power of the head of state and wield almost absolute control over decision-making. The rest are republics that have experienced long periods of authoritarian rule and repression.",

They cannot use social media like Facebook or Twitter.",
      "Outcome6": "One of the requirements of the CCR Rule is that each PWS must directly deliver a copy of its CCR to every customer by July 1st of each year. This means that the PWS must ensure that each person who receives water from the system gets a copy of the report, either by mail, email or another approved method. The PWS must also make a good faith effort to reach customers who do not get water bills, such as people who live in apartments, condos or mobile homes.\n There are six (6) different ways that a PWS can directly deliver its CCR to its customers, depending on the type of delivery method and the availability of customer information.

The URL must take the customer directly to the CCR without requiring them to search for it on a website. The notice can be sent as a postcard, an insert in the water bill, a statement on the water bill or a community newsletter.\nEmail - direct URL to CCR: The PWS sends an email to each customer who pays a water bill and has provided an email address, giving them a direct URL to access the CCR online. The URL must take the customer directly to the CCR without requiring them to search for it on a website.\nEmail - CCR sent as an attachment to the email: The PWS sends an email to each customer who pays a water bill and has provided an email address, attaching the CCR as an electronic file (for example, PDF).\nEmail - CCR sent as an embedded image in an email: The PWS sends an email to each customer who pays a water bill and has provided an email address, inserting the text and tables of the CCR into the body of the email (not as an attachment).\nAdditional electronic delivery that meets \"otherwise directly deliver\" requirement: The PWS delivers CCR through another electronic method that ensures that each customer who pays a water bill receives it and with approval from the state.

I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.",
      "Right": "At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.",

In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen."

As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was effective and fair, the protest would not happen.",
      "Outcome2": "Moreover, the school should focus on stimulating students' learning interest rather than increasing professors' income. Raising professors' salary does not guarantee better teaching quality or student performance. In fact, some professors may not deserve the pay raise and some students may protest against this policy. Therefore, this is not a wise way to improve education.",
      "Outcome3": "Furthermore, the ultimate purpose is to improve the education quality for students. Spending more money to raise professors' salary is not a relevant or effective way to achieve this goal. Moreover, it is unclear how the university would evaluate and monitor the performance of all the professors. Some professors may not be qualified or dedicated enough to deserve the higher salary. Raising salary does not necessarily motivate professors to teach better or care more about students. There is no evidence to support this assumption. In fact, there was a news report about a student protest against the proposal of raising professors' salary in my country. The protesters argued that this policy was unfair and wasteful.",
      "Outcome4": "Moreover, the goal is to inspire students to learn better. Raising professors' salary is not a good way to improve education. How will the university evaluate all the professors? Some of them may not be worthy of more money. Higher salaries do not make professors teach more effectively. This policy will have no impact on students' learning. In my country, there was a protest against increasing professors' salary. Most protesters were students who opposed this idea. This shows that students do not support this policy.",
      "Outcome5": "Another thing is, the school should help students learn better, not just pay the teachers more. Sometimes, some teachers are not very good at teaching, and they don't care about the students. Paying them more money will not make them teach better or care more. It will just make them happy and rich. There was a time when some people wanted to pay the teachers more money in my country. But many students did not like this idea, and they went out to say no to it. You can see that paying teachers more money is not a good way to make students happy or smart.",
      "Outcome6": "Moreover, the school should focus on the ultimate goal of education, which is to inspire and challenge students to achieve their full potential. To do that, simply spending more money to increase professors' salary is not an effective strategy. The school should also consider whether all the professors are qualified and dedicated enough to deserve the higher pay. Some professors may not care about teaching quality or student feedback, and they may just enjoy the benefits without making any improvement. On the other hand, high-salary instructors may not necessarily teach better or harder because they get more money. They may already have a fixed teaching style or method that works for them, and they may not want to change or adapt to different students' needs. Therefore, there is no guarantee that raising salary will improve education quality. In fact, this policy may cause resentment and dissatisfaction among students, who are the main stakeholders of education. For example, in my country, there was a news report about a plan to raise professors' salary in some universities. This plan sparked a protest from many students, who argued that it was unfair and unreasonable. They demanded that the money should be spent on improving facilities, curriculum, and student welfare instead.",

Moreover, sitting in front of the TV for hours can lead to back pain and obesity, as children become less physically active and more likely to snack on unhealthy foods. Furthermore, watching inappropriate or violent content on TV can expose children to harmful messages and images that can affect their mental well-being and behavior. A research by the University of Michigan found that children who watched more violent TV shows were more aggressive and had lower academic performance than those who watched less.",

Moreover, some of the programs that children watch may not be suitable for their age group and may expose them to violence, sexuality, or inappropriate language. This can negatively influence their behavior and mental health. Furthermore, watching TV can become an addiction for some children who prefer to watch their favorite shows like cartoons or sports rather than studying or doing homework.

Its members include state and sector associations, some of Australia's major logistics companies and businesses with leading expertise in truck technology. Through its members, the ATA represents many thousands of trucking businesses, ranging from owner drivers to large fleets.\n Introduction and summary\nAlthough automated vehicles pose opportunities for improved road safety and productivity, these vehicles also present significant safety risks and uncertainty to the general community.",
      "Right": "The ATA agrees that government has a key role to play in the safety assurance of automated vehicles. However, the ATA opposes any regulatory model that, threatens trucking businesses or impedes continued innovation or transition to automated and high productivity vehicles.\n A high priority must also be given to the introduction of independent, no-blame, safety investigations by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) for crashes involving automated vehicles. The best way to understand the causes of crashes involving automated vehicles and generate recommendations to prevent their recurrence would be for crashes to be investigated through a no-blame accident investigation process.\n Importantly, any legislative model must be nationally consistent and recognise the unique Australian road and road user context.\n Answers to NTC questions\nQuestion 1. Should government have a role in assessing the safety of automated vehicles or can industry and the existing regulatory framework manage this? What do you think the role of government should be in the safety assurance of automated vehicles?\n The ATA agrees that government should have a strong role in assessing the safety of automated vehicles but strongly opposes accreditation (option 4), because it would impose an intolerable compliance burden on small trucking businesses.\n The ATA's recommended approach is set out further in our response to questions 6-9.\nQuestion 2. Should governments be aiming for a safety outcome that is as safe as, or significantly safer than, conventional vehicles and drivers? If so, what metrics or approach should be used?\n The ultimate outcome of the introduction of automated vehicles should be a safer road system. Therefore, government should be aiming for a safety outcome that is significantly safer than conventional vehicles and drivers.\n High automation is qualitatively different to partial and conditional automation where the system adds to the drivers skills. As demonstrated through the heavy vehicle study completed by Curtin Monash Accident Research Centre (C-MARC) drivers exhibit variable levels of driving skills.\n If automated vehicles are to increase the safety of the road network, a highly automated system must prove to be safer than any human vehicle drivers.\n Question 3. Should the onus be placed on the automated driving system entity, to demonstrate the methods they have adopted to identify and mitigate safety risks?\nQuestion 4. Are the proposed assessment criteria sufficient to decide on the best safety assurance option? If not, what other assessment criteria should be used for the design of the safety assurance system?",

Coach Andy Robinson resigned after this run , and attack coach Brian Ashton was appointed head coach in December 2006 . England started the 2007 Six Nations Championship with a Calcutta Cup victory over Scotland . The championship also included a historic match at Croke Park against Ireland which England lost 43 – 13 , their heaviest ever defeat to Ireland .",
      "Right": "On 29 March 2012 , Stuart Lancaster , the former Elite Rugby Director at Leeds Carnegie was appointed England head coach by the Rugby Football Union . Previously Lancaster was appointed as the head coach on a short term basis assisted by existing forwards coach Graham Rowntree and Andy Farrell .\n Lancaster was considered a success in his first campaign as England coach - during the 2012 Six Nations Championship , defending Champions England finished in second place after losing 19 – 12 to Wales at Twickenham Stadium , but successfully defended the Calcutta Cup beating Scotland 13 – 6 at Murrayfield . England finished the year on a high , after outplaying World Cup holders New Zealand in November , in which England dominated to win 38 – 21 . The All Blacks had been unbeaten in 20 matches but were completely outplayed by England .\n During the 2013 Six Nations Championship again England finished in second place behind Wales after losing the opportunity of being Grand Slam winners for the first time since 2003 , by losing to Wales in Cardiff 30 – 3 . It was also the first time every team managed to win at least 3 competition points ( the equivalent of a win and a draw or three draws ) since 1974 . However , England did again defeat Scotland for the Calcutta Cup 38 – 18 at Twickenham .\n During the 2013 summer tour to South America in which Lancaster took an experimental side , England beat a South American select XV before a 2 – 0 series victory over Argentina , a first away series win against The Pumas for 32 years . England hosted the 2015 Rugby World Cup but were eliminated in the Pool stage , earning the unenviable reputation of being the first side in Rugby World Cup history to have hosted the tournament and yet to have failed to qualify for the knockout stages .",
      "Passage": "In the 2007 World Cup England played in Pool A with Samoa , Tonga , South Africa and the United States . They qualified for the quarter finals after losing embarrassingly to South Africa 36 – 0 where they defeated Australia 12 – 10 , and then faced hosts France in their semi final . England won 14 – 9 to qualify for the final against South Africa , which they lost 15 – 6 . England followed up the World Cup with two consecutive 2nd place finishes in the Six Nations , behind Wales and Ireland respectively . The 2009 Six Nations also saw former England Captain Martin Johnson take up the job of head coach . However , Johnson could not replicate his on-field success to management , and resigned in November 2011 following a miserable 2011 Rugby World Cup which ended in quarter-final defeat by France and featured a series of on and off-field controversies ."

      "Outcome1": "Despite low expectations, England reached the final of the 2007 World Cup after beating Australia and France in the knock-out stages. They faced South Africa, who had thrashed them 36-0 in the pool stage, and lost 15-6 in a tight contest. England's performance in the tournament was praised by many, including former captain Will Carling, who said: \"They have shown amazing character, spirit and guts.\" England followed up the World Cup with two consecutive second-place finishes in the Six Nations, behind Wales and Ireland respectively. The 2009 Six Nations also saw former England captain Martin Johnson take up the job of head coach. However, Johnson struggled to replicate his on-field success to management, and resigned in November 2011 after a disappointing 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign that ended in a quarter-final defeat by France and was marred by a series of on and off-field controversies. Former England fly-half Stuart Barnes commented: \"Johnson's tenure will be remembered for a lack of progress and direction.\"",
      "Outcome2": "England's 2007 World Cup campaign was a remarkable turnaround from their poor form in the previous years. They overcame the humiliation of a 36-0 loss to South Africa in the pool stage to reach the final, where they narrowly lost to the same opponents 15-6. England showed great resilience and defensive strength, beating Australia and France in close matches. In contrast, England's 2011 World Cup was a disappointment, as they failed to impress in any of their games. They scraped through the pool stage with unconvincing wins over Argentina, Georgia, Romania and Scotland, before being knocked out by France in the quarter-final 19-12. England's campaign was marred by off-field controversies involving players' behaviour and coaching staff's misconduct.",
      "Outcome3": "England faced Samoa , Tonga , South Africa and the United States in Pool A of the 2007 World Cup . Despite suffering an embarrassing 36 – 0 defeat to South Africa , they advanced to the quarter finals and stunned Australia with a 12 – 10 win . They then met hosts France in the semi final and overcame them 14 – 9 to reach the final against South Africa . However , they could not repeat their 2003 triumph and lost 15 – 6 to the Springboks . After the World Cup , England secured two consecutive second-place finishes in the Six Nations , losing out to Wales and Ireland respectively . Former England Captain Martin Johnson took over as head coach for the 2009 Six Nations , but he failed to replicate his on-field success in management . He resigned in November 2011 after a dismal 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign that ended with a quarter-final exit at the hands of France and featured several on and off-field controversies .",
      "Outcome4": "England reached the 2007 World Cup final after beating Australia and France, but lost to South Africa for the second time in the tournament. They were runners-up in the next two Six Nations, but struggled under coach Martin Johnson, who quit after a poor and scandalous 2011 World Cup.",
      "Outcome5": "England went to a big tournament in 2007 where they played with other teams from different countries. They did very well and got to the last game, but they lost to South Africa. After that, they tried hard to win other games, but they had some problems and their boss left. A new boss came in and he helped them play better. They beat a very good team called New Zealand, but they lost to Wales when they could have won everything. They also beat Scotland and Argentina, which made them happy.",
      "Outcome6": "Despite their poor form in the 2007 Six Nations Championship, England managed to reach the final of the 2007 World Cup in France. They were drawn in Pool A with Samoa, Tonga, South Africa and the United States, and had to overcome a humiliating 36 – 0 defeat to the Springboks in their second match to qualify for the quarter finals. There they faced Australia, who had won the previous two World Cups, and pulled off a stunning upset by beating them 12 – 10 with four penalties from Jonny Wilkinson. In the semi final, they met the hosts France at Stade de France and repeated their 2003 success by winning 14 – 9 with two tries from Josh Lewsey and Lewis Moody. England advanced to their second consecutive World Cup final, where they faced South Africa again. However, this time they could not match their opponents' physicality and accuracy, and lost 15 – 6 with only two penalties from Wilkinson to show for their efforts. Despite the defeat, England's performance in the tournament was widely praised as a remarkable turnaround from their previous struggles. After the World Cup, England continued to be competitive in the Six Nations, finishing second in both 2008 and 2009 behind Wales and Ireland respectively. The latter year also marked the beginning of Martin Johnson's tenure as head coach, following his appointment in July 2008. Johnson was a legendary figure in English rugby as the captain of the 2003 World Cup winning team, but he found it difficult to translate his success on the field to management. He resigned in November 2011 after a disappointing campaign at the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand, where England were knocked out by France in the quarter finals and also tarnished their reputation with several off-field incidents.",

      "Left": "On the planet Krypton , using evidence provided by scientist Jor-El , the Council sentences attempted insurrectionists General Zod , Ursa , and Non to the Phantom Zone , for which Zod swears revenge on Jor-El and his family . Jor-El , despite his eminence , is unable to convince the Council that Krypton will soon be destroyed when its red supergiant sun goes supernova . To save his infant son , Kal-El , Jor-El launches a spacecraft containing him toward Earth , a planet with a suitable atmosphere where Kal-El 's dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers . Shortly after the launch , Krypton 's sun explodes , destroying the planet .\n The ship crash lands on Earth near Smallville , Kansas . Kal-El , who is now three years old , is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent , who are astonished when he is able to lift their truck . They take him to their farm and raise him as their own , naming him Clark after Martha 's maiden name .\n At 18 , soon after Jonathan 's death due to a heart attack , Clark hears a psychic \" call \" and discovers a glowing crystal in the remains of his spacecraft . It compels him to travel to the Arctic , where the crystal builds the Fortress of Solitude . Inside , a holographic vision of Jor-El appears and explains Clark 's origins , educating him on his powers and responsibilities . After 12 years of training , with his powers fully developed , he leaves the Fortress wearing a blue suit with the House of El family crest on his chest and becomes a reporter at the Daily Planet in Metropolis . He meets and develops an unrequited romantic attraction to coworker Lois Lane .\n Lois becomes involved in a helicopter accident where conventional means of rescue are impossible , requiring Clark to use his powers in public for the first time to save her . That night , he thwarts a jewel thief attempting to scale a building using suction cups , captures robbers fleeing police , rescues a girl 's cat from a tree , and rescues Air Force One after it loses an engine , making the mysterious \" caped wonder \" an instant celebrity . He visits Lois at her home the next night and takes her for a flight over the city , allowing her to interview him for an article in which she names him \" Superman \" .",
      "Right": "Knowing Superman could stop his plan , Luthor lures him to an underground lair and exposes him to Kryptonite . As Superman weakens , Luthor taunts him by revealing that the first missile is a decoy , headed east toward Hackensack , New Jersey , realizing that even Superman can not stop both impacts . Teschmacher is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack , but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death . Knowing his reputation for keeping his word , Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition that he will deal with the New Jersey missile first . After diverting the eastbound missile into outer space , the other one aimed at the West Coast explodes near the San Andreas Fault . He is able to mitigate the effects of the nuclear explosion , getting rid of the pollution from the fallout and shoring up the crumbling Earth , but the aftershocks are still devastating .\n While Superman is busy saving others , Lois 's car falls into a crevice that opens due to an aftershock . It quickly fills with dirt and debris and she suffocates to death . Angered at being unable to save her , Superman ignores Jor-El 's warning not to interfere with human history , preferring to heed Jonathan 's advice that he must be on Earth for \" a reason \" . He accelerates around the Earth , rewinding time , in order to save Lois . He then delivers Luthor and Otis to prison and flies into the sunrise for further adventures .",

After his incompetent henchman , Otis , erroneously redirects the first rocket , Luthor 's girlfriend , Eve Teschmacher , successfully changes the course of a second missile while the military is distracted by a roadblock Luthor arranges ."

His girlfriend, Eve Teschmacher, frees Superman after he promises to stop the New Jersey missile first. He does so and then tries to prevent the disaster on the West Coast.",
      "Outcome5": "There is a bad man named Lex Luthor who wants to have a lot of money and land. He has a big plan to make the ground shake and break so that part of the country will fall into the water. He thinks this will make his land more valuable. He also knows that Superman is very strong and good and can stop him. So he tricks Superman to come to his hideout and shows him a green rock that makes Superman very weak and sick. Lex Luthor tells Superman that he has sent two flying bombs to different places. One of them will make the ground shake and break, and the other one will hurt people in another place. He says that Superman can not stop both bombs because they are too far away. Lex Luthor leaves Superman alone with the green rock, thinking he will die.\n\nBut Lex Luthor has a girlfriend named Eve who does not like his plan. She feels sorry for Superman and helps him get away from the green rock. She asks Superman to promise her that he will stop the bomb that is going to hurt people in another place first, because her mom lives there. Superman agrees and flies very fast to catch the bomb and throw it into space where it can not hurt anyone. Then he flies back to stop the other bomb, but it is too late. It makes the ground shake and break very hard, and many things go wrong.\n\nSuperman tries his best to fix everything, but he can not save everyone. He is very sad when he finds out that his friend Lois, who works as a reporter and likes him very much, has died because her car fell into a big crack in the ground. He remembers what his dads told him: one dad said he should not change what happens on Earth, but another dad said he was here for a reason. He decides to use his power to make time go backwards by flying around the Earth very fast many times. This way, he can save Lois from dying and stop Lex Luthor's plan before it happens.\n\nHe then takes Lex Luthor and his helper Otis to jail where they belong, and flies away with a smile.",

Luthor has secretly acquired two nuclear missiles and plans to launch them at strategic locations: one at the San Andreas Fault, which would cause California to sink into the ocean and leave his own desert land as the new coast; and another at Hackensack, New Jersey, as a diversion to distract Superman and the authorities. Luthor and his bumbling assistant, Otis, manage to hijack a military truck carrying the missiles, but Otis makes a mistake with the coordinates of the first missile, sending it to the wrong place. Luthor's girlfriend and accomplice, Eve Teschmacher, corrects the error for the second missile while Luthor sets up a roadblock to delay any pursuit.",

      "Right": "Beach Enclave's brand offering is unlike any other in the Caribbean as it affords guests the opportunity to enjoy the convenience and comfort of the services and amenities of a resort, as well as the luxury of a private home. Beach Enclave's amenities and services include dedicated butler/maid; private chef services; yoga sessions and spa services; among others. Beach Enclave guests also benefit from a concierge, who can manage requests such as housekeeping, grocery stocking, airport transportation, dining reservations and more as well as access to an oceanfront, fully equipped fitness room and yoga terraces looking out to the ocean and the distant reef barrier. Beach amenities are also available to guests and include the set-up of loungers and umbrellas, delivery of towels and water and the use of kayaks and snorkel equipment to explore the nearby coral reef. Guests can also arrange for activities such as kite surfing lessons and boating excursions on the water, one of the best ways to discover Turks & Caicos.\n With the design for the villas inspired by the idea of open air Caribbean living, the architecture and interiors of the Beach Enclave North Shore villas work together to create seamless transitions from exterior to interior spaces. The organic yet refined design presents an effortless, elegant and calm setting to take in the magnificent views and surroundings, which are truly the star of each private home. Materials echo nature in the driftwood finish of the millwork and the ocean color of various fabrics, while local iron-shore provides the grey tones of accent furniture. The cedar shingles and native stone of the exteriors are reinterpreted as greyed wood and creamy white floors inside the villas, while the sun-bleached palette is complimented with layered neutrals offset by watery blues and greens. Highlights of the exceptional furnishings include an oversized, suspended daybed of solid teak construction and fully upholstered, plush double chaise lounges, both catering to peaceful afternoons with room for two.\n Beach Enclave North Shore villas feature a fully equipped, top-of-the-line ocean-facing kitchen, with option to hire a chef for a meal or an entire stay, and indoor and outdoor dining is able to be enjoyed with the service of a private butler.

Wolseley to Khartoum , Sudan , in relief of General Charles Gordon .\n Briefly back in England in 1886 , Beato lectured the London and Provincial Photographic Society on photographic techniques .\n Felice Beato arrived in Burma probably in December 1886 , after Upper Burma had been annexed by the British in late 1885 . Much publicity had been made in the British press about the three Anglo-Burmese Wars , which had started in 1825 and culminated in December 1885 with the fall of Mandalay and the capture of King Thibaw Min .\n Beato , who had covered military operations in India and China , was probably attracted by the news of the annexation . While he arrived in Burma after the main military operations ended , he would still get to see more of the action , as the annexation by the British led to an insurgency which lasted for the following decade . This allowed Beato to take a number of pictures of British military in operations or at the Royal Palace , Mandalay , as well as insurgency soldiers and prisoners .",
      "Right": "His past experience and the credibility derived from his time in Japan brought him a large clientele of opulent locals , posing in traditional attire for official portraits . Other images , from Buddhas to landscapes and buildings , were sold from master albums in Burma and Europe .\n In 1896 , Trench Gascoigne published some of Beato ’ s images in Among Pagodas and Fair Ladies and , the following year , Mrs Ernest Hart ’ s Picturesque Burma included more , while George W. Bird in his Wanderings in Burma not only presented thirty-five credited photographs but published a long description of Beato ’ s businesses and recommended visitors to come by his shop .\n By that time , Beato ’ s photographs had come to represent the very image of Burma to the rest of the world , which it would remain for decades to come .\n As his curios business developed , with branches in Rangoon , Mandalay but also in Colombo and London , he also acquired the Photographic Art Gallery in Mandalay in 1903 , another photographic studio . In his old age , Felice Beato had become an important business party in Colonial Burma , involved in many enterprises from electric works to life insurance and mining .\n Scott O ’ Connor used a number of these images in his two books , The Silken East in 1904 and Mandalay and Other Cities of the Past in Burma in 1907 , popularizing Beato ’ s work to an even larger extent .",

      "Left": "Inspector Wood read out the facts concerning the allegation of the minor on the premises and tendered a set of three NT Drivers Licences, all in the name of the same minor and all of which had been altered in some way. He stated that over a twelve month period the minor had attempted to use these licences to gain entry into licensed premises in Darwin and Katherine. Following the confiscation of the licence in Darwin, Licensing Inspectors came to Katherine to discuss the issue with the minor's family and also briefed local Licensees on the matter.\n The CCTV footage viewed by the Commission during the Hearing clearly showed the minor entering the premises with security present at the entry point. The minor was also observed moving around the premises at various times and eventually leaving the premises. Mr Wood noted that the alteration of the driver's licence was a poor forgery and one that should have been readily identified by the crowd controllers on duty.\n Inspector Wood advised that there had been no evidence of sale of alcohol to the minor but he was drinking in the hotel and harm arose from that drinking as, after leaving the hotel, he was apparently involved in an altercation at a service station, came to the attention of Police and had to be taken into protective custody. Mr Wood submitted it was obvious from the footage that the Security Officer at the entrance of the Hotel did not make any attempt to thoroughly check the licence tendered by the minor.\n Inspector Wood noted that the Licensee was previously advised of the risk that this particular minor may attempt to enter licensed premises using an altered ID. He added that the family of the minor was well known to the Nominees.\n Inspector Wood read out the facts concerning the elderly man and noted that he appeared to be intoxicated and unsteady on his feet when he stumbled against the Hotel wall when he was entering the premises. The man had a conversation with the crowd controller at the entrance and, in Mr Wood's submission, the crowd controller should have been alerted to the state of intoxication of the man at that stage. Mr Wood noted that the man's condition deteriorated whilst he was inside the Hotel and drinking and that at one stage he fell against the pool table. The elderly man need the assistance of a companion due to his unsteadiness and was seen on the CCTV footage to urinate against the wall of the Hotel after leaving the premises. Inspector Wood tendered a series of photographs taken from the CCTV footage relating to both incidences and showed the entire footage at the Hearing.",
      "Right": "Mr Whelan noted that the elderly man did not do anything untoward whilst on the premises so as to bring his condition to the attention of staff of the premises. He submitted that the man entered the Hotel where sat and quietly became intoxicated over a period of approximately 2 hours. Mr Whelan made similar observations in respect of the minor in that he did nothing whilst on the premises to bring himself to the attention of staff or the crowd controllers.\n In his submission on penalty Inspector Wood stated that the Katherine Hotel had a previous offence, namely, serving an intoxicated person takeaway liquor at the bottle shop contrary to Section 102 of the Act. The Commission on 12 July 2010, in accordance with Section 124AAA of the Act, suspended the Hotel's take away licence for one day but suspended the penalty for a period of twelve months. At the time of issuing that penalty the Commission advised the Licensee as follows:\n Whilst significant weight has been given to the unblemished record of the Licensee in this case the Licensee should not expect that degree of leniency for any future breach. The Licensee should also be aware that any penalty imposed for subsequent breaches may not be limited to the bottle shop area of the licensed premises and may apply to the liquor licence generally. \"\nInspector Wood tendered copies of the previous Katherine Hotel decision and a series of previous decisions by the Commission for similar offences namely Squires Tavern, Ducks Nuts, Discovery and Crossways Hotel.\n Inspector Wood submitted that a licence suspension of two to five days should be considered by the Commission and, because of the circumstances which gave rise to noticing the offences, any suspension imposed should be concurrent rather than cumulative.\n Mr Whelan, in his submission on penalty, stated that the Licensee had not replied or offered any response to the Director of Licensing's letters of 27 September 2010 and 8 October 2010, which outlined the complaints, because advice from the Australian Hotels Association (\"AHA\") was that any response might incriminate the Licensee. He offered in mitigation the facts that there had been a clever deception by the minor and although the elderly man clearly became intoxicated whilst on the licensed premises, he caused no problem or known harm to himself or any other person.\n Mr Whelan stated that the problems arose due to difficulties in engaging competent security officers for the hotel.",
      "Passage": "Mr Whelan, for the Licensee, agreed with the facts given for both alleged breaches and stated that that he could not deny that the CCTV footage showed the elderly man was unsteady on his feet and did urinate outside the hotel. He said that neither the minor nor the elderly man caused any disruption or harm inside the hotel and therefore didn't bring themselves to the attention of the staff."

Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet.

      "Outcome6": "Another reason why I believe that the use of cars will decline in the next twenty years is that driving a car can cause various kinds of pollution to the environment. As more and more people become aware of the negative impacts of car emissions on the climate, the air quality, and the health of living beings, they will reconsider their choice of transportation mode. For instance, instead of driving their own cars separately, they can opt for taking a bus that can accommodate forty passengers at a time. This way, they can not only ease the traffic congestion by reducing the number of cars on the road, but also lower the amount of greenhouse gases and harmful particles emitted by vehicles.",

This year's report covers calendar year 2018. Please give this information to whoever is responsible for completing the report for your water system.\n The CCR Rule requires each PWS to mail or otherwise directly deliver one copy of its CCR to each customer by July 1st each year. The PWS must also make a good faith effort to reach customers who do not get water bills, for example, apartment dwellers.\n There are six (6) delivery methods that are identified as meeting the direct delivery requirement if the PWS is providing the report directly to each customer. The PWS may need to use a combination of delivery methods to reach all customers.\n Mail - paper copy: The PWS mails a paper copy of the CCR to each bill-paying customer.\n Mail - notification that CCR is available on website: The PWS mails to each bill-paying customer a notification that the CCR is available and provides a direct URL to the CCR where it can be viewed. A URL that navigates to a Web page that requires a customer to search for the CCR does not meet the \"directly deliver\" requirement. The mail method used for notification may be, but is not limited to, a postcard, water bill insert, statement on the water bill or community newsletter.\n Email - direct URL to CCR: The PWS emails to each bill-paying customer a direct URL to the CCR on a publicly available site on the Internet. A URL that navigates to a Web page that requires a customer to search for the CCR does not meet the \"directly deliver\" requirement.\n Email - CCR sent as an attachment to the email: The PWS emails to each bill-paying customer the CCR as an electronic file email attachment (for example, PDF).\n Email - CCR sent as an embedded image in an email: The PWS emails to each bill-paying customer the CCR text and tables inserted into the body of an email (not as an attachment).\n Additional electronic delivery that meets \"otherwise directly deliver\" requirement: The PWS delivers CCR through a method that otherwise directly delivers to each bill-paying customer and in coordination with the state. Delivery through social media is not allowed.",

If your system posts the CCR to a website, the web address (URL) must be included on the Certificate of Delivery as well as a copy of how the customers are notified of the web address (copy of bill, postcard, etc.).\n Please note the CCR Rule requires copies of the water quality report to be kept on file for no less than three (3) years.\n pc: E-File\nFill in date distributed to customers)\n In addition to providing the report to its customers, the system also certifies that the report was provided to the local county health department and has provided appropriate notices of availability. Further, the system certifies that the information contained in the report is correct and consistent with the compliance monitoring data previously submitted to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment.\n Check all that apply:\nAttach copy of notification that CCR is available on website; i.e. bill, letter, etc.)\nCertified by: Name:\n1000 SW Jackson; Suite 420\nTopeka, KS 66612-1367\n This brochure is a snapshot of the quality of the water that we provided last year.

We are committed to providing you with information because informed customers are our best allies. If you would like to observe the decision-making process that affect drinking water quality, please call TERESA TALKINGTON at 620-341-0666.\n Your water comes from 2 Ground Water Well(s):\nSome people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as those with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and other microbial contaminants are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791).\n Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants.",

The CCR also helps you communicate with your customers about the challenges and achievements of providing safe and reliable drinking water.\n\nThe deadline for delivering the CCR to your customers is July 1st, 2019. This year's report covers the period from January 1st to December 31st, 2018. You should give this letter and the enclosed information to whoever is responsible for completing the report for your water system.\n\nThe CCR Rule specifies six (6) delivery methods that you can use to meet the direct delivery requirement if you are providing the report directly to each customer. You may need to use a combination of delivery methods to reach all customers, especially those who do not get water bills, such as apartment dwellers or renters.

      "Outcome6": "Mark Henry 's raw squat and deadlift performance on July 16 , 1995 remains one of the most impressive feats of strength in powerlifting history . On that day , he squatted 430.0 kg ( 948.0 lbs ) and deadlifted 410.0 kg ( 903.9 lbs ) without using any supportive equipment , such as a squat suit or a deadlift suit . His combined weight of these two lifts , known as the \" squat-pull-2-lift-total \" , was 1851.9 lbs , which is the highest ever recorded in a competition . No other lifter has ever matched or surpassed this achievement in a drug-tested and raw powerlifting meet . The closest anyone has come to Henry 's record was Andrei <unk> , who squatted and deadlifted the same weight as Henry , but with a slightly lower total of 1829.8 lbs on October 22 , 2011 . Mark Henry also holds the third highest \" squat-pull-2-lift-total \" of all time , with his 953.5 lbs squat and 865.3 lbs deadlift at the WDFPF World Championships on October 29 , 1995 , totaling 1818.8 lbs . The only other lifters who have ever exceeded 1800 lbs in this category are Benedikt Magnusson with his amazing 975.5 lbs deadlift and 837.75 lbs squat for a total of 1813.3 lbs ; <unk> with his massive\n992 lbs squat and 815 lbs deadlift for a total of\n1808 ; and Don <unk> with his impressive\n904.5 lbs squat and\n885.5 lbs deadlift for a total of\n1790 .\n Mark Henry is not only the owner of the greatest all-time drug-tested raw ( unequipped ) Powerlifting Total in history at\n1060 kg ( \n2336.9 \nlbs ) ,\nbut he also has the second greatest total ever achieved in this category at \n1050 kg (\n2314.8 \nlbs ) .\nThese totals reflect his incredible strength across all three powerlifting disciplines : the squat , the bench press , and the deadlift .",

      "Left": "Antlion larvae eat small arthropods – mainly ants – while the adults of some species eat pollen and nectar , and others are predators of small arthropods . In certain species of Myrmeleontidae , such as Dendroleon <unk> , the larva , although resembling that of <unk> structurally , makes no pitfall trap , but hides in detritus in a hole in a tree and seizes passing prey . In Japan , Dendroleon <unk> larvae lurk on the surface of rocks for several years while awaiting prey ; during this time they often become coated with lichen , and have been recorded at densities of up to 344 per square metre .\n The larva is a voracious predator . Within a few minutes of seizing its prey with its jaws and injecting it with venom and enzymes , it begins to suck out the digestion products . The larva is extremely sensitive to ground vibrations , the low-frequency sounds made by an insect crawling across the ground ; the larva locates the source of the vibrations by the differences in timing of the arrival of waves detected by receptors , tufts of hairs on the sides of the two hindmost thoracic segments .",
      "Right": "Antlion larvae are capable of capturing and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods , and can even subdue small spiders . The projections in the jaws of the larva are hollow and through this , the larva sucks the fluids out of its victim . After the contents are consumed , the dry carcass is flicked out of the pit . The larva readies the pit once again by throwing out collapsed material from the center , steepening the pit walls to the angle of repose .\n Antlion larvae require loose soil , not necessarily but often sand . The larvae prefer dry places protected from the rain . When it first hatches , the tiny larva specialises in very small insects , but as it grows larger , it constructs larger pits , and thus catches larger prey , sometimes much larger than itself .\n Other arthropods may make use of the antlion larva 's ability to trap prey . The larva of the Australian horsefly ( <unk> <unk> ) lives in antlion pit traps and feeds on the prey caught , and the female chalcid wasp ( <unk> <unk> ) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax .",
      "Passage": "In trap-building species , an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2 in ( 5 cm ) deep and 3 in ( 7.5 cm ) wide at the edge . This behavior has also been observed in the <unk> ( Diptera ) , whose larvae dig the same sort of pit to feed on ants . Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove , the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards , using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil . By the aid of one front leg , it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head , then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations . Proceeding thus , it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center . As it slowly moves round and round , the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper , until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose ( that is , the steepest angle the sand can maintain , where it is on the verge of collapse from slight disturbance ) . When the pit is completed , the larva settles down at the bottom , buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface , often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone . The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva 's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom . Since the sides of the pit consist of loose sand at its angle of repose , they afford an insecure foothold to any small insects that inadvertently venture over the edge , such as ants . Slipping to the bottom , the prey is immediately seized by the lurking antlion ; if it attempts to scramble up the treacherous walls of the pit , it is speedily checked in its efforts and brought down by showers of loose sand which are thrown at it from below by the larva . By throwing up loose sand from the bottom of the pit , the larva also undermines the sides of the pit , causing them to collapse and bring the prey with them . Thus , it does not matter whether the larva actually strikes the prey with the sand showers ."

      "Outcome1": "One way to appreciate the efficiency of the pitfall trap is to compare it to a fishing net. A fishing net can catch many fish at once, but it also requires a lot of energy and skill to set up, maintain, and haul in. A pitfall trap, on the other hand, is like a single fishing hook that is baited and left in the water. It does not catch as many prey, but it also does not require much energy or skill to create and operate. The antlion larva simply digs a hole in the sand and waits for an unsuspecting insect to fall in. The loose sand acts as both the bait and the weapon, luring and dislodging the prey into the larva's mouth. The pitfall trap is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom.",
      "Outcome2": "As the larva waits for its prey at the bottom of the pit, it relies on its keen sense of vibration to detect any movement. In trap-building species , an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2 in ( 5 cm ) deep and 3 in ( 7.5 cm ) wide at the edge . This behavior has also been observed in the <unk> ( Diptera ) , whose larvae dig the same sort of pit to feed on ants . The antlion larva begins by carving out a circular groove with its abdomen , then walks backwards while tossing up loose soil with its head and one front leg . It gradually spirals towards the center , deepening and widening the pit until it reaches the optimal slope angle for trapping prey . The larva then buries itself in the soil with only its jaws exposed , ready to snap at any insect that falls into the pit . The loose sand on the sides of the pit makes it difficult for the prey to escape , and the larva further hampers their efforts by throwing sand showers at them from below . These sand showers also cause the pit walls to collapse and slide down , bringing the prey closer to the larva 's mouth . The antlion larva 's trap is one of the most simple and effective hunting strategies in nature .",
      "Outcome3": "Some kinds of antlion larvae make a hole in the ground to catch food. The hole is shaped like a cone and has very loose dirt on the sides. The larva digs the hole by walking backwards and tossing dirt over its head with one of its front legs. It makes the hole deeper and deeper until the dirt is very easy to slide down. Then it hides at the bottom of the hole, with only its mouth parts sticking out. The larva waits for other small animals, like ants, to come near the edge of the hole. When they do, they lose their balance and fall into the hole. The larva quickly grabs them with its mouth parts, which have sharp tubes inside. The tubes inject poison and juices that break down the prey's body. Then the larva sucks out the liquid food and throws away the dry remains. It fixes the hole by moving more dirt from the middle to the sides, making them slippery again. The larva can do this many times until it grows bigger and needs bigger food.",
      "Outcome4": "Some antlion larvae dig cone-shaped pits to trap ants and other insects. They fling sand at the prey to knock them down and bite them with venomous jaws. The larvae sense the prey's vibrations with hair-like receptors on their body. The pit's slope is steep and unstable, making escape difficult for the prey. The larvae's trap is simple but effective. Other flies and wasps may also exploit the pit for their own benefit.",
      "Outcome5": "Some antlion babies like to dig holes in the sand to catch bugs for food. They make the holes very deep and steep, so the bugs can't climb out easily. The antlion baby waits at the bottom of the hole with its mouth open, ready to grab any bug that falls in. If a bug tries to get away, the antlion baby throws sand at it to make it fall back down. The antlion baby has a very clever way of making its hole, so it can catch many bugs without much trouble.",
      "Outcome6": "Some species of antlion larvae are trap-builders, creating conical pits in the soil to catch their prey. These pits are about 2 in (5 cm) deep and 3 in (7.5 cm) wide at the top, and are dug by the larva using its abdomen as a shovel and its front leg as a lever. The larva moves backwards in a circular pattern, flinging the loose soil out of the pit with a flick of its head. As it digs deeper, the slope of the pit becomes steeper, reaching the critical angle of repose, which is the maximum angle that the soil can sustain without collapsing. The larva then settles at the bottom of the pit, hiding under the soil with only its jaws exposed above the surface. It waits patiently for an unsuspecting insect to wander near the edge of the pit, such as an ant. The slippery slope of the pit makes it difficult for the prey to escape, and as it slides down towards the center, it is quickly grabbed by the larva's powerful jaws. The larva injects venom and enzymes into its prey, liquefying its internal organs and sucking them out. If the prey tries to climb up the walls of the pit, it is met with showers of sand that are thrown by the larva from below, causing more instability and erosion. The larva can also use this strategy to deliberately collapse the walls of the pit and bring down larger prey that are too heavy to lift with its jaws. This way, it does not matter if it misses its target with its sand projectiles. The trap that these antlion larvae construct is one of the simplest and most effective hunting devices in nature.",

      "Left": "CASE STUDY - Multi-agency Approach to Reducing Exclusions\nDescribe the situation prior to intervention\nPrior to this intervention a Year 7 Child in Care was exhibiting inappropriate and poorly regulated physical interactions with peers. Although their attendance was good a series of Fixed Term Exclusions meant that without intervention a Permanent Exclusion was imminent.\n What did the school do?\nUsing specialist staff and a multi-agency approach\nThe school referred the pupil for the REDS (full name then hyperlink) intervention through their Educational Psychology Service. This intervention supported the school to translate exhibitive behaviours into pupil needs; the multi agency team supporting the pupil met to describe the difficulties the pupil was facing at school. These behaviours were then listed as needs, which could then be matched to support and intervention. This list of pupil needs were key to ensuring everyone involved understood why the behaviour was happening.",
      "Right": "Throughout the pupil and carer were fully involved in the process. The plan was focused but flexible to change when things went wrong.\n What other factors lead to success?\n The key to success was the positive inclusive mindset of the school. Staff took collective ownership of the pupil; the commitment and empathy of staff meant that even in challenging times they did not give up on supporting this pupil. The role of the Pupil Coach was critical to the plan being executed consistently on a daily basis.\n This intervention was well planned; the pupil's needs were known years prior to joining the school so work began early on to form trusted relationships with school staff.\n What are the outcomes?\n This intervention saw an immediate reduction in challenging behaviours; the risk of permanent exclusion fell from a 9/10 likelihood to 1/10 very quickly. Now, over two years later, the pupil has started to self regulate their behaviours and can recognise and search out support for themselves.\n The pupil remains in this mainstream school; there have been occasional set backs but the risk of permanent exclusion has diminished. The pupil has more positive peer relationships and trusts the adults at school to support him. The carer feels strongly that this intervention made the difference\nWhat can we learn from this case study?\nThe REDS project encouraged exhibitive behaviours to be translated into needs; the school's SEN leader says that even two years on the original list of needs derived from the REDs programme are still used regularly by school staff. The school's strategic approach was focused upon the pupil needs, rather than the presenting behaviours. This gave a very clear focus to interventions and support. Even though they had a strategic plan, they remained flexible to change their approach when challenges arose.\n The school feel the \"consistent trusted adults\" were the key to the success of this pupil staying in a mainstream school. Indeed relationships and communication played a key part. It was clear that leaders foster a strong culture of ownership of SEN pupils across the school exemplified by the other members of the leadership team being involved in review meetings. This was a truly collaborative intervention both from within and outside the school. Outside agencies worked together on the agreed plan; essential in this success was the role of the SEN leader to coordinate all the professionals involved then communicate with school staff to drive forward the agreed plan. This case really illustrates how inclusion works best when an inclusive mindset is truly embedded into the fabric of a school.",

They used the REDS framework to identify and understand the underlying needs behind the pupil's behaviours, and to match them with appropriate support and intervention strategies. The list of needs became a shared reference point for everyone involved, ensuring a common understanding and language. The intervention strategies were delivered through pastoral support, which focused on building on the pupil's strengths and developing trusted relationships with staff. The school recognised that relationships were crucial for this pupil, and ensured that there was a consistent message from all staff about expectations and support.",

The basilica was used for the administration of justice and the governance of the city .

The building is 42.2 m ( 138 ft ) long by 22.3 m ( 73 ft ) wide and originally had two storeys . Its interior is dominated by two rows of columns framing the apses at each end of the building where the magistrates sat . The outer wall of the basilica , which is faced with columns , overlooks the forum where markets were held . Small temples and public offices also lined the 1,300 m2 ( 14,000 sq ft ) forum , which would have been full of statues of emperors and local dignitaries , of which only the pedestals now remain . Not much is known about the public buildings which existed in Volubilis prior to the start of the 3rd century , as the buildings currently visible were built on the foundations of earlier structures .",

It appears to have been built on top of , or converted from , an earlier Punic temple , which may have been dedicated to Baal . It is a sanctuary with a surrounding wall and a three-sided portico . In its interior was a small temple with a cella built on a shallow podium . The temple 's traditional identification with Saturn is purely hypothetical and has not generally been accepted .\n Volubilis also possessed at least three sets of public baths . Some mosaics can still be seen in the Baths of Gallienus , redecorated by that emperor in the 260s to become the city 's most lavish baths . The nearby north baths were the largest in the city , covering an area of about 1,500 m2 ( 16,000 sq ft ) . They were possibly built in the time of Hadrian .",

Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to beseech the aid of the gods or to thank them for successes in major civic undertakings such as fighting wars . The layout of the temple , facing the back wall of the basilica , is somewhat unusual and it has been suggested that it may have been built on top of an existing shrine .

An altar is located in the courtyard, in front of 13 steps that lead up to the temple, which had a single cella and Corinthian columns. The temple was of great significance for civic life, as it was dedicated to the three main gods of the Roman state: Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. Civic assemblies were held in front of the temple to ask for the help of the gods or to thank them for their support in major civic projects, such as wars. The temple's layout, facing the back wall of the basilica, is unusual and it may have been built over an existing shrine. An inscription found in 1924 by archaeologist Henri Terrasse reveals that the temple was rebuilt in 218 CE (Terrasse 1925). It underwent partial restoration in 1955 and a more extensive one in 1962, which reconstructed 10 of the 13 steps, the walls of the cella and the columns (Euzennat 1977).

An inscription says it was rebuilt in 218. It was partly restored in the 1950s and 1960s. Four smaller shrines were also in the temple area, one for Venus.",
      "Outcome5": "There is a big building behind the other big building where people talked and made decisions. The big building behind has some tall sticks with curly tops and a place to pray to the gods. The people who lived in the city thought there were three main gods who helped them with everything. Sometimes they would go to the place to pray and ask the gods for help or say thank you. The place to pray was different from other places because it was facing the wrong way. Maybe it was built on top of an older place to pray. A long time ago, someone wrote that they fixed the place to pray and made it look nicer. Later, some other people also fixed it and made it look like it does now. There were four more places to pray inside the big building behind, and one of them was for the god of love.",
      "Outcome6": "Behind the basilica, within a walled enclosure that was originally surrounded by columns, stands the Capitoline Temple. This temple was the most important religious building in the city, as it was dedicated to the three main gods of the Roman pantheon: Jupiter, Juno and Minerva. These gods represented the interests and values of the Roman state, and their worship was essential for the well-being and prosperity of the community. The citizens of Volubilis would gather in front of the temple for civic ceremonies and rituals, such as offering sacrifices or celebrating military victories. The temple itself had a classical design, with a portico of Corinthian columns supporting a triangular pediment and a single chamber (cella) where the statues of the gods were housed. The temple faced the rear wall of the basilica, creating a visual and symbolic connection between religion and politics in Roman society. However, this arrangement was unusual for a Capitoline Temple, and it has been suggested that it may have been built over an earlier sanctuary that had a different orientation. An inscription found near the temple indicates that it was rebuilt or renovated in 218 AD, possibly after some damage or destruction. The temple was partially restored in modern times, with some steps, walls and columns reconstructed to give an impression of its original appearance. In addition to the main temple, there were also four smaller shrines within the enclosure, one of which was dedicated to Venus, the goddess of love and beauty.",

      "Outcome1": "On the other hand, universities should not only respect students' preferences, but also promote more diversity and equality in different subjects. According to a report by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, only 28% of researchers worldwide are women, and they are underrepresented in fields such as engineering, mathematics, and computer science. Similarly, men are less likely to pursue degrees or careers in the humanities, such as languages, arts, and education. This gender gap in some subjects can limit the opportunities and perspectives of both male and female students. Therefore, universities should encourage more girls to explore their potential in science subjects and more boys to enrich their knowledge in the humanities.",
      "Outcome2": "Another point to consider is that universities have a responsibility to promote gender equality and diversity in different fields of study, and this could benefit both the students and the society as a whole. By encouraging more girls to pursue science subjects and more boys to explore the humanities, universities could help break the stereotypes and barriers that limit the potential and opportunities of both genders. This could also foster a more collaborative and innovative culture in various sectors of the economy.",
      "Outcome3": "On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to pursue science subjects and more boys to explore the humanities, and this could reduce the gender gap in fields like engineering or philosophy. It would harm students' mental health to study in a setting where they are surrounded by only one gender.",
      "Outcome4": "However, universities could motivate girls to pursue science and boys to explore humanities, and this could balance gender in some subjects. Studying in a single-gender environment could harm students' mental health.",
      "Outcome5": "Another thing, schools can help more girls and boys learn different things. For example, some girls might like to learn about stars and rockets, and some boys might like to learn about stories and poems. This can make them happy and smart in different ways. It is not good for them to only learn with other girls or boys who like the same things.",
      "Outcome6": "On the other hand, universities should also take some measures to encourage more girls to pursue science subjects and more boys to explore the humanities, and this could help to avoid the imbalance of gender in some fields of study. Studying in an environment where there is only one gender or a dominant gender could have a negative impact on students' mental health, as they may feel isolated, pressured, or stereotyped by their peers and teachers.",

This upcoming school year will mark our 28th year of providing quality afterschool fun to the children of the Upper West Side.\n Here is what we offer:\nSports & Stuff is available Monday-Friday from 3:00-6:00PM. Our flexible approach allows your children to attend 1,2,3,4, or all 5 days. We gather the kids from their classrooms, provide a snack, and then the afternoon begins.\n The Pre-K (Must be 4 years old to attend) and Kindergarten program is very unique. They have their own program coordinator and staff working with them. Each day is broken down into three 40 minute periods. Periods include gym time, yard time, crafts, cooking, science, hallway games, treasure hunts, etc. No two days are ever alike. The last program period ends at 5:25PM and pickup is from 5:30PM-6:00PM. That being said, parents are allowed to come get their children at any time during the afternoon.\n We also offer specific enrichment programs during the week that are run by outside instructors (Soccer, Theater, Science etc.). Classes are an additional fee, fill up quickly and typically run from 3:15PM-4:15PM. Children can make these classes a part of their afternoon at Sports & Stuff and rejoin the general program once the class is over or you may just sign up for the classes (and just pay the class fee) and come pick your child up when the class ends. If you choose to have your child rejoin the general program after their class ends, the fee is $25 for the remainder of the afternoon.\n Invoices are e mailed out on a monthly basis and payments are due by the 1st of each month. There are no refunds/credits for incidental absences, but we are more than happy to offer you a makeup day for any missed days.",

      "Passage": "Finally, it's our flexibility that has been the key to our success. You may join the program at any time during the school year. You can change your child's schedule whenever you need to and your invoice will be adjusted accordingly. You can send your child on a day he/she doesn't normally attend if needed. Even those children who don't attend the program on a regular basis may join in if the need arises for a day. We even offer full and half day trips when school is let out early or not in session at all."

You can sign up for as many or as few days as you want, and change them as often as you need. You can also drop in your child on a day they don't usually attend if something comes up.

You can try different things like soccer, theater, science and more. Or you can just play with your friends in the gym or the yard. And if you miss a day, you can come another day instead.

You can also send your child on a drop-in basis if you have a last-minute need or a special occasion. We welcome children who are not regular participants to join us for a day of fun and learning. We also offer full and half day trips when school is closed or has early dismissal. These trips are open to all children, whether they attend Sports & Stuff regularly or not.",

      "Left": "This trend points to the inadequacy of current legal enforcement mechanism in addressing this important issue. Following the resounding adoption of the new Constitution, and the subsequent promulgation of legal reforms under the new Constitution, it was inevitable to have new laws introduced to cater for the rights of women both locally and internationally. These reforms are expressly provided for in the Constitution under articles 27(1) among other articles. The new Constitution also provides for the use of international instruments under article 2(5) and 2(6),as a means to enhance protection of fundamental rights and freedom of the marginalized. However, the question is: will the laws be implemented to ensure that the status of women in politics is elevated?\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD)\nConventions on Political Rights of Women (CPRW)\nInternational Covenants on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disability\nThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability was adopted on 13th December,2006 at the UN headquarters. The Convection follows decades of work by the United Nations to change attitudes and approaches to persons with disability. In its preamble the Convention recognizes that despite having other laws, the rights of persons with disability have not been fully taken care of. It states: Concerned that despite these various instrument and undertaking persons with disability continues to face barriers in their participation as equal members of society and violations of their human rights in all parts of the world. Participation doesn't mean that only adults are catered for as they are the ones who can vote and be elected. Article 7 caters for the rights of children with disability in relation to their right to participation. The right to participation proper has been dealt with under Article 29 and 30 with 29 providing for the right to participate in political and public life and 30 providing for the right to participate in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sports. A part form creating rights that Convention has created obligations to be undertaken by the political parties these are: Under Article 30 of the Convention, the right to participate in outdoor activities has been well elaborated. This has been through creation of obligations these being: State parties shall recognize the right of persons with disability to take part on an equal basis with others in cultural life, and shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that persons with disabilities:",
      "Right": "The regional instrument that provide for the right of women to equal participation in the political field includes the Banjul charter. The mother treaty of the African Women's Rights Protocol, the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights, was adopted on 27th June 1981 and entered in force on 21st October. The African Charter was meant to provide for the fundamental freedoms and the right of the signatories regional countries Kenya being among them. The charter provides for the duties of the citizens and the government at one level in the achievement of the rights of the citizens.\n The promulgation of the Constitution on 27th august 2010 ushered in a new beginning for Kenya. It secured the right to equal participation of women in democratic governance. The Constitution further accords women equal opportunity and equal status as their male counter parts and also addresses affirmative action as a way that will be used to ensure that the provisions are met. Under the 2010 constitution, the bill of rights is presented as an integral part of Kenya's democracy and the framework for social, economic and cultural policies it thus has both judicial and extra judicial utility. Applied in the later form, it runs beyond the present of the law and judicial tribunals to be the thread that weaves through national policy and agenda. This is consistent with the purpose of the bill of rights which is to preserve the dignity of individuals and communities and promote social justice and realisation of the potential of all human beings. Compared to the repealed Constitution, the 2010 Constitution is unique in a number of critical respects it exhibits salient features like it's exhaustive catalogue of human rights and expansive non-discrimination clause and expresses regard for substantive equality. Article 2(5) and 2(6) recognise the use of international law, that is, treaties and the general rules of law ratified by Kenya. International law have a wide range of specific provisions on fundamental rights and freedom. Further article 10(1) (a) of the Constitution provides for equal participation of marginalised groups. The provision for the inclusion of all should be based on equality and free from non-discrimination. To ensure that all enjoy their fundamental rights as embodied in the Constitution, article 20(2) states that, \"Every person shall enjoy the rights and fundamental freedom in the bill of rights to the greatest extent consistent with the nature of the right or the fundamental freedom.\"",

Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.",

Sometimes, there are too many buses and cars on the roads and they get stuck. This makes people angry and late. I also have this problem when I finish school and want to go home quickly. But if the roads are bigger, there will be more space for everyone to move and they will not bump into each other.",

By expanding the width and length of the roads, we can accommodate more public transportation vehicles as well as personal ones. This can reduce the congestion and save time for commuters. For example, I often face a lot of difficulties when I try to get home from school at peak hours. The roads are packed with buses, cars, motorbikes and bicycles, and it takes me an hour to travel a short distance. However, if the roads are enlarged, the traffic flow will be smoother and faster, and I can reach home in half an hour or less. Furthermore, widening the roads can also prevent collisions and accidents that often occur due to limited space and visibility.",

      "Left": "First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth.",
      "Right": "In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.",
      "Passage": "In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion."

    "Outcome": {
      "Outcome0": "",
      "Outcome1": "However, some people may argue that improving roads and highways is also beneficial for the society. They may claim that better roads and highways can facilitate the transportation of goods and services, boost the economic development, and enhance the safety of drivers and passengers. These are valid points, but they do not outweigh the benefits of developing public transportation. As mentioned above, public transportation can reduce carbon emission, ease traffic jam, and encourage people to adopt a more sustainable lifestyle.",
      "Outcome2": "Therefore, the policy would be crucial for easing traffic congestion. It is undeniable that traffic jam is a serious problem in many big cities. The main cause of this issue is the excessive number of vehicles on roads. To address the problem, governments have to encourage people to use more buses, trains, or subways instead of private cars and motorbikes. Improving roads and highways alone may not be enough to solve the root of traffic congestion.",
      "Outcome3": "Moreover, the policy would have a crucial role in easing traffic congestion. According to the World Health Organization, traffic congestion is one of the main causes of air pollution and noise stress in urban areas. The primary factor behind this problem is the excessive use of private vehicles on roads. To address this issue, governments need to encourage people to switch to public transport by providing more convenient and affordable options. Improving roads and highways alone may not solve the root cause of traffic congestion, as it may also increase the demand for driving.",
      "Outcome4": "Moreover, the policy would help ease traffic congestion. Many big cities suffer from this problem due to too many vehicles on roads. The best way to solve it is to encourage people to use public transport instead of private ones. Building more roads and highways may not address the root cause of traffic congestion.",
      "Outcome5": "Another reason is that the policy would help people get to places faster and easier. You know that sometimes there are too many cars and motorbikes on the road, and they make a lot of noise and take up a lot of space. This makes it hard for people to go where they want to go. To solve this problem, governments have to make more people use big vehicles that can carry many people at once, like buses, trains, or subways. These big vehicles need less space on the road than many small vehicles. Making the roads and highways bigger does not really fix the problem of too many small vehicles.",
      "Outcome6": "Another benefit of the policy is that it would help to alleviate traffic congestion. It is undeniable that traffic jam is a major challenge in many urban areas. The main culprit for this situation is that there are too many vehicles crowding the roads. To address this issue, governments have to encourage people to use public transport instead of private cars and motorbikes. This would reduce the number of vehicles on the roads and free up more space for traffic flow. Improving roads and highways, on the other hand, may not be an effective solution, as it does not tackle the root cause of traffic congestion.",
